# Architecture

## System overview

`documents-rag` is a local-first RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform. Everything runs on
the user's machine via Docker Compose, with Ollama providing local LLM and embedding inference —
no external API calls or cloud dependencies.

This milestone is infrastructure plus ten vertical slices: a FastAPI app wired to Postgres,
Redis, Qdrant, and Ollama, with a health endpoint, an Ollama health/model-availability check, a
concrete Ollama-backed embedding provider, a concrete streaming Ollama-backed LLM provider, a
concrete Qdrant-backed vector store, a rule-based RAG decision layer, a document upload +
ingestion job skeleton, an async ingestion worker that claims and resolves those jobs, a
document text extractor (`.txt`/`.md`/`.pdf`/`.docx`/`.xlsx`), a document chunker that splits
extracted text into fixed-size, overlapping, word-boundary-aware chunks, and chunk
embedding/Qdrant indexing — the worker's pipeline is now Document → extraction → chunking →
embedding → Qdrant upsert. No retrieval or chat endpoint happens yet — a claimed job's chunks
are embedded and their vectors upserted into Qdrant, but nothing yet reads them back out for
retrieval; the job resolves to `completed` only if extraction, chunking, embedding, and the
Qdrant upsert all succeed.

## Services

| Service    | Image                    | Purpose (current)                                             | Purpose (future) |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `app`      | built from `Dockerfile`  | FastAPI process: `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/providers/ollama/health`, `POST /api/v1/documents` | RAG API: ingestion processing, retrieval, chat |
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine`     | Stores `documents`/`ingestion_jobs` rows via async SQLAlchemy     | Session/metadata storage |
| `redis`    | `redis:7-alpine`         | Available on the network                                         | Caching, task queues |
| `qdrant`   | `qdrant/qdrant:latest`   | Collection create/upsert/search via `QdrantVectorStore`           | Backing document retrieval in a future RAG flow |
| `ollama`   | `ollama/ollama:latest`   | Health/model checks + embeddings (`bge-m3`) + streaming generation (`llama3.1`) | Backing a future public chat endpoint |

The app queries Ollama's `/api/tags` endpoint (via `app/services/ollama_client.py`) to check
reachability and whether the configured models are pulled, calls `/api/embeddings` (via
`app/rag/providers/ollama_embedding_provider.py`) to embed text with `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`,
and calls `/api/generate` with `stream=true` (via `app/rag/providers/ollama_llm_provider.py`) to
stream completions from the configured chat model (`LLM_MODEL`, falling back to
`OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL` — see "LLM provider vs. model" below). The LLM provider is internal-only —
there is no public chat or SSE endpoint yet. The app also talks to Qdrant's HTTP API under
`QDRANT_URL` (via `app/rag/providers/qdrant_vector_store.py`) to create collections, upsert
vectors, and run similarity search — see "Vector store" below. Callers resolve all of these
providers through `app/rag/providers/provider_factory.py` rather than importing Ollama/Qdrant
classes directly — see "Provider factory" below. `POST /api/v1/documents` stores an uploaded
file and creates `Document`/`IngestionJob` rows in Postgres — see "Document upload and ingestion
job skeleton" below. Nothing yet processes an `IngestionJob`; Redis is still unused beyond
connection configuration.

## Provider factory

`app/rag/providers/provider_factory.py` resolves which concrete provider class to construct,
based on three config variables, so the rest of the codebase depends on the `EmbeddingProvider` /
`LLMProvider` / `VectorStore` interfaces rather than being coupled to Ollama or Qdrant directly:

- `get_embedding_provider()` — `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` (`"ollama"` → `OllamaEmbeddingProvider`)
- `get_llm_provider()` — `LLM_PROVIDER` (`"ollama"` → `OllamaLLMProvider`; `"openai"`, `"gemini"`,
  `"anthropic"` are recognized but raise `ProviderNotImplementedError` — see "Future LLM provider
  stubs" below)
- `get_vector_store()` — `VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER` (`"qdrant"` → `QdrantVectorStore`)

An unrecognized provider name raises `UnsupportedProviderError` (a `ValueError`) with a message
naming the offending value and the supported provider(s). All Ollama-specific logic (HTTP calls,
error handling) stays inside the Ollama provider classes — the factory only selects and
constructs; it never reimplements provider behavior, and business/service code should resolve
providers through it rather than importing `OllamaEmbeddingProvider`/`OllamaLLMProvider` directly.
The factory never falls back to Ollama for a misconfigured or unimplemented provider — every
non-`ollama` value either resolves to its own explicit failure or a real alternative
implementation.

## LLM provider vs. model

`LLM_PROVIDER` (which backend to use, e.g. `ollama`) and `LLM_MODEL` (which model that backend
should use, e.g. `llama3.1`) are deliberately separate settings — changing the model doesn't
require touching provider selection, and vice versa. `Settings.resolved_llm_model`
(`app/core/config.py`) is the single place that decides the effective model: it returns
`LLM_MODEL` if set, otherwise falls back to `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL` for backward compatibility.
`OllamaLLMProvider` calls `resolved_llm_model`, never `ollama_chat_model` directly, when building
its `/api/generate` request.

`OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL` is intentionally **not** part of this model-selection mechanism —
embeddings use a fixed model, independent of `LLM_MODEL`, since swapping the embedding model
would silently invalidate any previously-computed vectors. `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` always reads
`ollama_embedding_model` directly.

## Vector store

`app/rag/providers/vector_store.py` defines the abstract `VectorStore` contract plus its shared
data types:

- `VectorPoint` — one embedding vector to upsert, with `id`, `vector`, and payload metadata
  (`document_id`, `chunk_id`, `text`, `source`, optional `page_number`, optional `sheet_name`).
- `VectorSearchResult` — one nearest-neighbor match: `id`, `score`, plus the same payload fields.

`VectorStore` methods: `create_collection_if_not_exists(collection_name, vector_size)`,
`upsert_vectors(collection_name, points)`, `search_similar(collection_name, query_vector, limit)`.

`QdrantVectorStore` (`app/rag/providers/qdrant_vector_store.py`) is the concrete implementation.
It talks to Qdrant's REST API directly under `QDRANT_URL` via async `httpx` — **no official
Qdrant SDK is used**, matching the same pattern as the Ollama providers. It calls:

- `GET /collections/{name}` + `PUT /collections/{name}` — check-then-create a collection
  (skips creation if the collection already exists).
- `PUT /collections/{name}/points?wait=true` — upsert points (id, vector, payload).
- `POST /collections/{name}/points/search` — similarity search, returning parsed
  `VectorSearchResult` objects.

`QdrantVectorStoreError` is raised on an unreachable server, a non-200 response, or a malformed
response (e.g. missing payload fields). `IngestionWorker` is now a caller (see "Chunk embedding
and Qdrant indexing" below) — no other caller wires it into a retrieval pipeline yet.

## RAG decision layer

`app/rag/decision.py` is a small internal decision/orchestration layer that classifies a user
question *before* any retrieval or generation happens — it does not itself perform retrieval,
generation, ingestion, or document upload, and is not wired to any public API endpoint.

- `RagDecision` (a `StrEnum`) — one of `NEEDS_RETRIEVAL`, `DIRECT_LLM`,
  `CLARIFICATION_NEEDED`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE`.
- `DecisionResult` — a dataclass with `decision`, `reason`, and an optional `confidence`.
- `RuleBasedRagDecider.decide(question) -> DecisionResult` — deterministic, keyword/pattern-based
  routing. **No LLM call is made to route** — rules are checked in order:
  1. Empty or very short question → `CLARIFICATION_NEEDED`.
  2. Sensitive/private data extraction requests (SSN, passwords, API keys, credentials, etc.) →
     `OUT_OF_SCOPE` — checked *before* the retrieval keywords, so a request that mentions both
     documents and sensitive data is still rejected.
  3. Question references uploaded/indexed documents (`document`, `uploaded`, `pdf`, `knowledge
     base`, etc.) → `NEEDS_RETRIEVAL`.
  4. Otherwise → `DIRECT_LLM` (general question, no document reference, nothing sensitive).

This is deliberately the simplest possible decider — a future milestone may replace or augment it
with an LLM-based router, but the rule-based version exists first so the decision *contract*
(`RagDecision`/`DecisionResult`) is fixed and testable before anything calls out to a model for
routing.

**Multilingual decision patterns.** Every pattern above has a Hebrew equivalent, in the same
single `RuleBasedRagDecider` — neither `CustomRagEngine` nor `LangChainRagEngine` implements its
own decision logic (no `CustomHebrewDecider`/`LangChainHebrewDecider`). Retrieval-intent patterns
cover Hebrew document/file references (`מסמך`/`מסמכים`, `קובץ`/`קבצים`, uploaded/attached/indexed
conjugations, "according to the file/document," "based on," "knowledge base," "written in the
file/document") — meaningful intent phrasing, never bare Hebrew-script detection: a Hebrew
question with none of these phrasings (e.g. "how does the system store vectors?") routes to
`DIRECT_LLM` like an equivalent English one. Extraction-intent patterns mirror the English
verb-near-sensitive-noun proximity check with Hebrew verbs (show/reveal/give/send/extract/
disclose) and nouns (password, credit card, ID number, credentials, secret/private key, bank
account), so "how do I reset a password?" (`איך מאפסים סיסמה?`) stays in scope exactly like its
English equivalent. A question mixing Hebrew and embedded English technical identifiers (e.g.
`איך Qdrant שומר את ה-embeddings לפי המסמך?`) is classified on the Hebrew retrieval-intent phrase
alone, same as an English question with an embedded Hebrew entity name.

## Storage Abstraction (Phase 2.6/2.7)

`app/storage/` is the provider-neutral storage layer every upload/ingestion/extraction/re-index
code path depends on — never a filesystem path or a MinIO SDK type directly.

- **`FileStorage`** (`app/storage/contract.py`) — the abstract contract: `save`, `read`,
  `delete`, `exists`, `get_metadata`, `generate_download_url`. Returns only `StoredFile`/
  `FileMetadata` (both `app/storage/contract.py`), never a provider SDK response type or a raw
  filesystem path.
- **`LocalFileStorage`** (`app/storage/local_storage.py`) — local-disk implementation. Object
  keys are relative POSIX-style paths resolved safely under a configured root
  (`LOCAL_STORAGE_ROOT`, default `storage/documents`); `app/storage/keys.py`'s
  `validate_object_key` rejects absolute paths and `..` traversal before any filesystem call.
- **`MinioFileStorage`** (`app/storage/minio_storage.py`) — S3-compatible object storage via the
  official `minio` Python SDK (used directly rather than raw `httpx`, unlike this project's
  Ollama/Qdrant providers — S3 request signing (SigV4) makes a raw-HTTP reimplementation a much
  larger, riskier undertaking than this phase calls for). Every SDK/`urllib3` exception is
  translated to a `StorageError` subclass before leaving this module.
- **`create_file_storage(settings)`** (`app/storage/factory.py`) — the *only* place a concrete
  storage class is constructed, mirroring `app/rag/providers/provider_factory.py`'s pattern
  exactly: one `if` on `FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER` (`local`/`minio`), one dedicated
  `StorageConfigurationError` for anything else. No route, worker, or service branches on the
  provider name itself.
- **Object keys** (`app/storage/keys.py`) — `generate_object_key(document_id, original_filename)`
  builds `documents/{document_id}/{uuid-hex}{safe-suffix}`; the storage provider never invents
  its own key. `resolve_document_storage_key(document)` returns `document.storage_key` if set,
  else falls back to `document.stored_path` — this is the sole backward-compatibility path for
  documents written before this migration (see "Document/collection indexing metadata" below).
- **Storage error hierarchy** (`app/storage/errors.py`) — `StorageError` and subclasses
  (`StorageUnavailableError`, `StorageObjectNotFoundError`, `StorageWriteError`,
  `StorageReadError`, `StorageDeleteError`, `StorageMetadataError`,
  `StorageConfigurationError`, `StorageUrlGenerationError`, `StorageKeyError`). Every
  implementation translates its own provider-specific failures into one of these before the
  exception leaves the adapter, preserving the original exception as `__cause__`. Messages
  include the operation/key where safe; never a credential, connection string, or signed URL.
- **Download URLs** (`generate_download_url`) — `LocalFileStorage` returns a `file://` URI (an
  internal representation only, never returned to a client). `MinioFileStorage` returns a
  time-limited presigned GET URL (`MINIO_PRESIGNED_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS`, default 3600s). Neither
  is ever persisted — the persisted identity is always `storage_provider`/`storage_bucket`/
  `storage_key`, never a URL. **`GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/download`** (Phase 2.8.2 —
  see "Document read APIs and original download" below) deliberately does *not* use
  `generate_download_url()` at all: it streams bytes through the application via
  `FileStorage.read()` instead, so a MinIO endpoint/bucket/credential is never exposed to a
  client, regardless of the configured provider.
- **Bucket initialization** (`MinioFileStorage.ensure_bucket()`) — checks whether the configured
  bucket exists; creates it only if `MINIO_CREATE_BUCKET_IF_MISSING` (default `true`); a
  `BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou`/`BucketAlreadyExists` race from concurrent startup is treated as
  success, never a failure. Never recreates or resets an existing bucket.

**Cross-system boundary — storage and PostgreSQL are not one atomic transaction.**
`app/services/document_upload_service.py`'s `upload_document()` sequence is: save the object to
`FileStorage` → persist `Document` + `IngestionJob` rows → commit. If the commit fails after the
object was already saved, a best-effort delete of that object is attempted (failure there is
logged, never raised) before the *original* DB exception is re-raised unchanged — this is not
described as atomic anywhere, and a partially-completed attempt is not indistinguishable from one
that never ran (the orphaned object may still exist in storage until a future cleanup pass; no
orphan-cleanup worker exists yet — out of scope for this phase).

## Document upload and ingestion job skeleton

`POST /api/v1/documents` (`app/api/v1/routes/documents.py`) is the first public endpoint that
touches the database. The route is a thin controller — it reads the upload, rejects an empty
file with `400`, and delegates the save/persist/commit sequence to
`app/services/document_upload_service.py`'s `upload_document()`, which:

1. Generates an object key (`generate_object_key`) and saves the file via the injected
   `FileStorage` (resolved once per request through `create_file_storage()` — see "Storage
   Abstraction" above; the route depends on the abstract `FileStorage`, never a concrete class).
2. Inserts a `Document` row (`app/models/document.py`): `original_filename` (stored exactly as
   received — Hebrew or any other Unicode text is preserved verbatim), `stored_filename`,
   `content_type`, `file_size`, `stored_path` (legacy, kept for backward read compatibility),
   plus the provider-neutral `storage_provider`/`storage_bucket`/`storage_key`/`storage_etag`.
3. Inserts an `IngestionJob` row (`app/models/ingestion_job.py`) with `status=PENDING`,
   referencing the `Document` via `document_id`. `IngestionStatus` (a `StrEnum`): `PENDING`,
   `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED` — stored in Postgres as their lowercase `.value`
   (`pending`, `processing`, ...), not the enum member name.

The endpoint returns `202 Accepted` with `{document_id, job_id, status}` — **it does not parse,
chunk, embed, or index the document inside the request.** An empty (zero-byte) upload is
rejected with `400` before any row is created. `IngestionWorker` (below) is what eventually
picks up and resolves the `pending` job it creates.

## Document read APIs and original download (Phase 2.8.2)

Five strictly read-only endpoints (`app/api/v1/routes/documents.py`) let a client inspect a
document's lifecycle and download its original content. **None of them mutate anything** —
Postgres, object storage, Qdrant, `IngestionJob` rows, and `VectorCleanupJob` rows are all
untouched by every route in this section. `POST /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/ingestion/retry`
(Phase 2.8.3, see "Ingestion retry and stale-job recovery" below) is the one mutating route this
module adds; there is still no delete, re-index (a separate existing endpoint/service), or
reconciliation endpoint.

- `GET /api/v1/documents?limit=&offset=` — one page of documents (`created_at` DESC, `id` DESC
  tiebreaker), each with its derived lifecycle `status` and total row count. `limit` defaults to
  20, capped at 100; `offset` defaults to 0. Always `200`.
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}` — one document's detail: identity, size, content type,
  `storage_provider` (never `storage_bucket`/`storage_key`/`storage_etag` — see "Storage
  Abstraction" above), indexing metadata (`collection_name`/`embedding_version`/
  `chunking_version`/`indexed_at`), and its latest ingestion job's id/status. `404` if the
  document doesn't exist.
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/ingestion` — the document's latest `IngestionJob`'s
  id/status/`created_at`/`updated_at`. `404` only if the *document* doesn't exist; a document
  with no ingestion job yet is a `200` with `job_id`/`status`/`created_at`/`updated_at` all
  `null` — a legitimate lifecycle state, not a missing resource (see "Lifecycle status
  derivation" below for whether this is actually reachable in practice).
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/failure` — the document's latest **FAILED** ingestion
  job, with a sanitized `safe_message` (see "Ingestion failure sanitization" below). `404` both
  when the document itself is missing and when the document exists but has never failed — "no
  failure to inspect" is treated as absent-resource, unlike the ingestion-status endpoint's
  `200`-with-null choice above (deliberately different, since "inspect the failure" implies one
  should exist).
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/download` — streams the document's original bytes.
  `404` if the document row doesn't exist. `409` if the row exists but its storage object is
  missing (a real document/storage inconsistency — deliberately *not* `404`, since the document
  itself is real). `503` if the storage backend itself is unreachable/failing for a reason other
  than not-found. On success: `200` with `Content-Type` set from `Document.content_type` and
  `Content-Disposition: attachment` carrying both an ASCII-fallback `filename="..."` and an
  RFC 5987/6266 `filename*=UTF-8''...` percent-encoded form, so a Hebrew/Unicode original
  filename survives HTTP header encoding (headers are Latin-1/ASCII) without being mangled or
  raising. Reads the full object into memory via `FileStorage.read()` (both `LocalFileStorage`
  and `MinioFileStorage` return `bytes`, not a stream) and returns it in one `Response` — the
  same unbounded-memory characteristic `POST /api/v1/documents` already has today (`await
  file.read()`, no size limit anywhere in this codebase); this is not a new risk introduced
  here, and is a known, accepted limitation to revisit if large-file support becomes a
  requirement. Uses **application streaming**, never a redirect to a presigned URL — a MinIO
  endpoint/bucket/credential is never exposed to a client this way, and `generate_download_url()`
  is not called by this endpoint at all.

**Query layer**: `app/services/document_query_service.py` owns every read query behind these
routes, following the flat function-based style of `app/services/index_registry.py` (no
`app/repositories/` abstraction exists in this codebase). Routes stay thin per CLAUDE.md's
"Route Layer Style": parse query params, inject `AsyncSession`/`FileStorage` via `Depends`, call
one service function, copy its typed result's `status_code` (`DocumentDetailResult`/
`DocumentIngestionResult`/`DocumentFailureResult`/`DocumentDownloadResult`, mirroring
`platform_health.ReadinessResult`'s pattern) — no aggregation/business logic lives in the route
module, and no route ever returns a SQLAlchemy `Document`/`IngestionJob` directly (always through
a Pydantic response schema in `app/schemas/documents.py`).

**Lifecycle status derivation** (`DocumentLifecycleStatus`, `app/schemas/documents.py`; computed
by `derive_lifecycle_status()` in `document_query_service.py`) is sourced from a document's
*latest* `IngestionJob` (`created_at` DESC, `id` DESC tiebreaker) plus `Document.indexed_at`:

| Latest job | `indexed_at` | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none | — | `uploaded` |
| `PENDING` | — | `pending` |
| `PROCESSING` | — | `processing` |
| `FAILED` | — | `failed` |
| `COMPLETED` | any | `indexed` |

No `IngestionJob` at all (`uploaded`) is, in practice, unreachable through the normal upload
flow — `upload_document()` always creates exactly one `Document` and one `IngestionJob` row in
the same commit — so this status exists defensively for any pre-existing/malformed data, not as
a state a client should expect to see from a document created through the API. A `COMPLETED` job
should always imply `indexed_at is not None` (`IngestionWorker.process_next_job()` commits both
in the same transaction, including for zero-chunk documents — see "Zero-chunk behavior" below),
but `derive_lifecycle_status()` still reports `indexed` even in the theoretical case where
`indexed_at` is somehow null, treating the job's own status as authoritative rather than
inventing a new status. No `deleting`/`deleted` status exists — there is no delete endpoint yet.

**Ingestion failure sanitization**: `IngestionJob.error_message` is a raw `str(exception)` (see
"Ingestion worker" below) that can embed a connection/host detail (e.g. a `QdrantVectorStoreError`
wrapping an `httpx` connect error's message). `sanitize_ingestion_error()` never returns this raw
string to a client — the `/failure` endpoint's `safe_message` is always one fixed, generic
constant ("Document ingestion failed. See server logs for the underlying error."), mirroring
`app/api/v1/routes/chat.py`'s `_SAFE_ERROR_MESSAGE` pattern rather than attempting to pattern-match
"safe" substrings out of arbitrary exception text. The raw message stays in Postgres for operator/
log inspection. `IngestionFailureResponse` has no `retryable` field — this codebase has no
attempt-count tracking, so a boolean here would be fabricated rather than genuinely derived. This
sanitization rule now extends to retry/recovery too (Phase 2.8.3): a stale-recovered job's
`error_message` (the fixed `STALE_RECOVERY_ERROR_PREFIX` marker — see below) is stored in
Postgres exactly like any other `error_message`, and passes through the same
`sanitize_ingestion_error()` before ever reaching an API response — no new sanitization path was
added, and none was needed.

**N+1 avoidance**: `GET /api/v1/documents` resolves every page row's latest job with exactly one
batched query (`get_latest_jobs_for_documents()` — `WHERE document_id IN (...)`, grouped by
`document_id` in Python), never one query per row.

## Ingestion retry and stale-job recovery (Phase 2.8.3)

`app/services/ingestion_retry_service.py` adds two Postgres-only, transactional operations on top
of the existing `IngestionWorker`/`IngestionJob` model — neither touches `FileStorage` or a vector
store directly:

- **`retry_ingestion()`** — the service behind `POST /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/ingestion/retry`.
- **`recover_stale_ingestion_jobs()`** — an internal maintenance operation with no HTTP endpoint,
  invoked by the standalone `scripts/recover_stale_ingestion_jobs.py` (`make
  recover-stale-ingestion-jobs`).

### `POST /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/ingestion/retry`

Decision table, driven by the document's *latest* `IngestionJob` (same `created_at` DESC, `id`
DESC ordering as the read APIs above):

| Latest job | Stale? | Outcome | HTTP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document doesn't exist | — | `DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND` | `404` |
| none | — | `CREATED` (treated like FAILED — unreachable via the normal upload flow, same defensive stance as `DocumentLifecycleStatus.UPLOADED` above) | `202` |
| `PENDING` | — | `ALREADY_ACTIVE` (existing job returned, nothing new scheduled) | `200` |
| `PROCESSING` | no | `ALREADY_ACTIVE` | `200` |
| `PROCESSING` | yes (`> INGESTION_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS`) | `CREATED` — the stale row is flipped to `FAILED` in the *same commit* as the new job (see below) | `202` |
| `FAILED` | — | `CREATED`; the FAILED row is never modified | `202` |
| `COMPLETED` | — | `ALREADY_COMPLETED` (re-index is a separate endpoint/service, not this one) | `409` |

A `CREATED` response inserts a brand-new `PENDING` `IngestionJob` row for the existing
`IngestionWorker` to claim and process exactly like a first attempt — retry never resets,
deletes, or replays an old row's status; ingestion history is append-only.

**Why a stale-PROCESSING retry must flip the old row, unlike a FAILED retry**: the partial unique
index below allows at most one `PENDING`/`PROCESSING` row per document. A `FAILED` row is already
outside that set, so a new `PENDING` insert alongside it is always legal. A still-`PROCESSING` row
is *inside* that set — inserting a new `PENDING` row while it stays `PROCESSING` would violate the
index outright. So `retry_ingestion()` transitions a stale `PROCESSING` row to `FAILED` (using the
identical fixed `STALE_RECOVERY_ERROR_PREFIX` marker `recover_stale_ingestion_jobs()` uses) as
part of the same commit that creates the replacement — a client-triggered "reactive" recovery and
the background "proactive" one (below) are indistinguishable in stored data, just triggered from
two different call sites.

### One active job per document — a real Postgres constraint

At most one `IngestionJob` per `document_id` may be `PENDING`/`PROCESSING` — enforced by a real
partial unique index, `ix_ingestion_jobs_one_active_per_document` (migration `b7e2f6a1c9d4`,
`ON ingestion_jobs (document_id) WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing')`), not merely
application logic. `IngestionStatus` is stored as a plain `VARCHAR` (`native_enum=False`), so the
partial index's `WHERE` clause matches the lowercase string values directly.

The migration also runs a defensive, idempotent cleanup pass immediately before creating the
index: for any document somehow already having more than one active row, it keeps only the most
recently created one active and marks the rest `FAILED` with a fixed migration-reason message.
Given the codebase at the time of this migration — `upload_document()` creates exactly one
`PENDING` job per upload, and no prior retry/re-index path could create a second job while one was
already active — this is believed genuinely unreachable in any installation that only ever ran
code up to this PR; the cleanup pass exists so the migration cannot fail outright even if that
assumption turns out to be wrong for some out-of-band data, without silently dropping a row.

**Concurrency**: `retry_ingestion()` takes a blocking `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the document's
existing job rows before deciding whether to insert, so two concurrent retries for an
already-active document serialize instead of racing. A residual race remains when the latest job
is `FAILED`/absent/stale-`PROCESSING` — inserting a brand-new row is never covered by a lock taken
on rows that already existed when the lock was acquired — closed by catching the unique index's
`IntegrityError` at commit time and re-reading/returning the now-existing active job instead of
raising. Proven against real Postgres (not a fake session) by
`tests/integration/test_ingestion_retry_postgres.py::test_two_concurrent_retries_produce_exactly_one_new_active_job`,
which runs two independent `AsyncSession`s racing via `asyncio.gather()`.

### `recover_stale_ingestion_jobs()`

Finds `PROCESSING` jobs whose row hasn't been updated in `INGESTION_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS`, locks up
to `INGESTION_RECOVERY_BATCH_SIZE` of them with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (`updated_at
ASC, id ASC`, mirroring `IngestionWorker._claim_next_pending_job()`'s exact locking pattern so two
concurrent recovery runs never both recover the same row), marks each `FAILED` (fixed
`STALE_RECOVERY_ERROR_PREFIX` message, never deleted/reset), and creates one fresh `PENDING`
replacement per recovered row. Idempotent — a job it already recovered is `PROCESSING` no longer,
so a later call never re-selects it.

**Stale detection is an approximation, not a liveness proof.** `IngestionJob` has no dedicated
heartbeat column — `updated_at` (`onupdate=func.now()`) is the only available signal. A
`PROCESSING` job whose `updated_at` is older than the threshold is *probably* abandoned
(crashed/killed worker), but a genuinely slow-but-alive worker looks identical.
`INGESTION_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` (default `900`) should be set well above the platform's expected
worst-case single-document processing time.

**Trigger mechanism**: `scripts/recover_stale_ingestion_jobs.py` (`make
recover-stale-ingestion-jobs`) — a standalone script, not an `app/cli/` package (this repo has no
existing CLI-package convention; introducing one for a single operation would be more machinery
than warranted), mirroring `scripts/smoke_multilingual_real.py`'s style. It is optional/manual,
never invoked by `make verify`/`make test*`/CI — the same operational boundary
`smoke-multilingual-real` already establishes for real-provider checks. A real scheduler
deployment (cron, Kubernetes CronJob, etc.) wiring this script to run periodically is intentionally
out of scope for this phase.

### Vector idempotency is free — no cleanup mechanism needed for retry

`IngestionWorker._default_process_document()` performs exactly one embedding call followed by
exactly one `vector_store.upsert_vectors()` call; if extraction/chunking/embedding raises, that
happens strictly before `upsert_vectors()` is ever reached — **a `FAILED` (or stale-recovered) job
never wrote any vectors to Qdrant.** Chunk IDs (`f"{document.id}-{chunk_index}"`,
`app/services/document_chunker.py`) and their derived Qdrant point IDs
(`uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_URL, chunk.chunk_id)`, `to_vector_point()` in
`app/services/ingestion_worker.py`) are fully deterministic for a given document, so a retry's
eventual successful upsert naturally overwrites the same point IDs a first successful attempt
would have used — Qdrant's own upsert-by-ID semantics make this idempotent with no extra
mechanism. No delete-before-retry step, temporary-collection-swap, or new cleanup logic was added
for this phase, and none is needed.

This was verified against real Qdrant, not just asserted:
`tests/integration/test_ingestion_retry_postgres.py::
test_retry_after_real_failure_writes_no_orphaned_vectors_then_succeeds` forces a real first
attempt to fail (an embedding-provider error injected before `upsert_vectors()`), confirms zero
points exist in the real ephemeral Qdrant container for that document, then retries and lets the
real `IngestionWorker` process the new job with a working embedding provider, confirming it
completes and its points are searchable via `search_similar()`. The one edge case this does *not*
cover —
orphaned points if chunking parameters change *between two genuinely-successful* indexing runs of
the same document with different chunk counts — is structurally unreachable within retry/recovery's
scope: both only ever fire for a job that never reached `upsert_vectors()`. That scenario belongs
to a future chunking-upgrade migration, deliberately out of scope here (see "Boundaries" in
CLAUDE.md).

### `IngestionWorker` claim safety — confirmed, not modified

`IngestionWorker._claim_next_pending_job()`'s existing `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claim
(see "Ingestion worker" below) was reviewed and found to already satisfy every property this phase
needed: atomic claim, `PROCESSING` committed before expensive work starts, a crashed worker leaves
a recoverable `PROCESSING` row (which is exactly what stale recovery targets), and a
`COMPLETED`/`FAILED` job is never reclaimed. It was not modified, and does not need to be — retry
and recovery both only ever create a new `PENDING` row for the existing worker to pick up through
its unchanged claim path.

## Full document deletion (Phase 2.8.4)

Safe, idempotent, asynchronous deletion of a document's vectors and original stored object,
across PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and object storage. **PostgreSQL remains authoritative and the
`Document` row is never physically deleted** — a successful deletion never removes the
`Document` row, nor any `IngestionJob`/`VectorCleanupJob`/`DocumentDeletionJob` history; only the
document's external resources (Qdrant vectors, the stored object) are removed. This phase does
not implement hash deduplication, orphan reconciliation, version-aware re-indexing, a background
scheduler deployment, retention/purge policy, bulk deletion, or physical row deletion — those
remain explicitly out of scope.

### Documents service package (`app/services/documents/`)

Deletion service code lives in a small package, split by dependency direction rather than in one
mixed module:

- `app/services/documents/deletion_service.py` — request-scoped deletion state and scheduling:
  deletion-status reads (`get_latest_deletion_job()`/`get_latest_deletion_jobs_for_documents()`),
  `request_document_deletion()`, the `DeletionRequestOutcome`/`DeletionRequestResult` types routes
  map to HTTP status, and public error sanitization (`DeletionErrorCode`/
  `sanitize_deletion_error()`). This is what API routes and `document_query_service.py`/
  `ingestion_retry_service.py` import.
- `app/services/documents/deletion_worker.py` — background deletion execution:
  `DocumentDeletionWorker`, the claim/vector-cleanup/storage-cleanup/completion orchestration.
  This is what `scripts/process_pending_document_deletions.py` and tests exercising execution
  import.

`deletion_worker.py` depends on `deletion_service.py` (for the shared `DeletionErrorCode`
constants) — never the reverse. This mirrors the real production dependency direction: API routes
only ever need scheduling/status, never execution; only the out-of-band script/tests need
execution, and execution itself needs the shared error-code vocabulary defined on the service
side.

### `DocumentDeletionJob` — an append-only deletion-attempt ledger

`app/models/document_deletion_job.py` mirrors `IngestionJob`'s lifecycle style: `id`,
`document_id`, `status` (`DocumentDeletionStatus`: `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `PARTIALLY_FAILED`,
`COMPLETED` — stored as a plain `VARCHAR`, `native_enum=False`, exactly like `IngestionStatus`),
`vector_cleanup_completed`/`storage_cleanup_completed` (booleans tracking that attempt's
progress through the two-step cleanup order below), `error_code` (a stable, machine-identifiable
marker — see "Error model" below), `error_message` (the raw internal detail, Postgres-only, never
returned by a public API verbatim), `created_at`/`updated_at`/`completed_at`. A
`PARTIALLY_FAILED` row is never reset back to `PENDING` and never deleted — retrying always
creates a brand-new row for the same `document_id`; deletion history is append-only, exactly like
ingestion retry.

**One active deletion job per document** is enforced by a real partial unique index,
`ix_document_deletion_jobs_one_active_per_document` (migration `c8f3a2b6d1e7`,
`ON document_deletion_jobs (document_id) WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing')`), mirroring
`b7e2f6a1c9d4`'s ingestion-job index exactly. Unlike that migration, `c8f3a2b6d1e7` adds **no**
defensive duplicate-row cleanup before creating the index: `document_deletion_jobs` is a
brand-new table created in the same migration, so no duplicate-active-row data can possibly exist
yet in any installation — there is no reachable path to duplicate data here at all, not merely an
unreachable-in-practice one (unlike the ingestion-job migration, which added its index onto a
pre-existing, already-populated table).

### Scheduling: `request_document_deletion()` — the service behind `DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}`

`app/services/documents/deletion_service.py`'s `request_document_deletion()` only ever schedules a
deletion by inserting a `PENDING` `DocumentDeletionJob` row — it never performs the actual
cross-system cleanup itself, so the HTTP request never blocks on unbounded external I/O. Decision
table, driven by the document's latest `DocumentDeletionJob` and (when relevant) its latest
`IngestionJob`:

| Condition | Outcome | HTTP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Document doesn't exist | `DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND` | `404` |
| Latest deletion job `COMPLETED` | `ALREADY_DELETED` (idempotent; no new job) | `200` |
| Latest deletion job `PENDING`/`PROCESSING` | `ALREADY_ACTIVE` (existing job returned) | `202` |
| Latest deletion job `PARTIALLY_FAILED`, or none yet, **and** latest ingestion job is `PENDING`/`PROCESSING` | `INGESTION_ACTIVE` — deletion never races an in-flight ingestion | `409` |
| Latest deletion job `PARTIALLY_FAILED`, or none yet, and ingestion is not active | `CREATED` — a new `PENDING` `DocumentDeletionJob` is inserted | `202` |

A completed or failed ingestion never blocks deletion — full tracked cleanup is still required
even for a document whose ingestion never succeeded, since an original object/historical vectors/
cleanup records may still exist for it.

**Concurrency**: `request_document_deletion()` takes a blocking `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the
document's existing deletion-job rows before deciding whether to insert, exactly mirroring
`retry_ingestion()`'s pattern — so two concurrent delete requests for the same document serialize
instead of racing. The residual insert race (a brand-new row is never covered by a lock on rows
that already existed) is closed by catching the partial unique index's `IntegrityError` at commit
time and re-reading/returning the now-existing active job instead of raising.

### Execution: `DocumentDeletionWorker` — out-of-band, mirroring `IngestionWorker`

`app/services/documents/deletion_worker.py`'s `DocumentDeletionWorker` is the execution side —
kept in a separate module from `deletion_service.py`'s request-scoped scheduling (see "Documents
service package" below for the full module boundary).

**Design choice**: this codebase has no deployed background-worker *process* for `IngestionJob`
either — `IngestionWorker.process_next_job()` is only ever invoked by test fixtures and
`scripts/`, never inline inside `POST /api/v1/documents`. `DocumentDeletionWorker` mirrors this
exact architecture rather than introducing a new one: `DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}` only ever
schedules (inserts a `PENDING` row); the actual cross-system cleanup is a separate, independently
testable operation — `DocumentDeletionWorker.process_next_job(session)` — invoked by
`scripts/process_pending_document_deletions.py` (`make process-pending-document-deletions`,
optional/manual, mirroring `scripts/recover_stale_ingestion_jobs.py`'s boundary: never run by
`make verify`/`make test*`/CI) or directly by test code.

`DocumentDeletionWorker.process_next_job(session)`:

1. **Claim**: `SELECT ... WHERE status='pending' ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE SKIP
   LOCKED` — the identical locking pattern `IngestionWorker._claim_next_pending_job()` uses, so
   multiple worker invocations never claim the same job. Returns `None` if there is no pending job.
2. Flips the claimed job to `PROCESSING` and **commits immediately**, before any external I/O.
3. **Vector cleanup, strictly before storage cleanup**: calls
   `index_registry.delete_all_tracked_document_vectors(document, vector_store, session)` — the
   full-tracked-collection operation (targets the document's active collection *and* every
   distinct historical collection still tracked by a pending/failed `VectorCleanupJob`) — **never**
   `delete_current_document_vectors()` (the deliberately-partial, active-collection-only sibling).
   If any targeted collection's deletion fails, the job is marked `PARTIALLY_FAILED` with
   `vector_cleanup_completed=False` and `error_code=DOCUMENT_VECTOR_CLEANUP_FAILED`, and the
   method returns immediately — **storage cleanup is never attempted in that call**, enforced
   structurally by the code path (there is no branch reaching storage deletion without first
   observing `VectorDeletionResult.fully_deleted is True`), not merely as a documented intention.
4. On full vector-cleanup success, `vector_cleanup_completed` is committed `True`, then
   `FileStorage.delete(storage_key)` is called. An already-missing object is treated as an
   idempotent success (per `FileStorage.delete()`'s existing contract — see "Storage Abstraction"
   above); any other failure (`StorageError` subclass) marks the job `PARTIALLY_FAILED` with
   `storage_cleanup_completed=False` and `error_code=DOCUMENT_STORAGE_CLEANUP_FAILED`.
5. Only when both steps succeed is the job marked `COMPLETED` with `completed_at` set — this is
   the only path a document's public lifecycle status becomes `deleted` (see below).

**Why vectors before storage**: searchable derived content (vectors) must stop being searchable
before a document is ever reported as deleted; the original object plays no role in retrieval, so
it can safely be cleaned up afterward (and retried independently) without risking a document that
looks "deleted" while still being findable through chat/retrieval.

**Retry is append-only, not resumable-in-place.** A `PARTIALLY_FAILED` job's
`vector_cleanup_completed`/`storage_cleanup_completed` flags describe *that* attempt only.
Retrying (calling `request_document_deletion()` again) creates a brand-new `PENDING` row that
re-attempts both steps from scratch — always safe, because `delete_all_tracked_document_vectors()`
and `FileStorage.delete()` are both independently idempotent (re-deleting already-absent
vectors/objects is a harmless no-op success), so re-running an already-completed step costs
nothing but the extra I/O. No cross-job "resume" bookkeeping exists or is needed.

`IngestionWorker._claim_next_pending_job()` itself was reviewed and left **unmodified** — it
already satisfies every property this phase needed, and `DocumentDeletionWorker` uses its own,
independent claim query against `document_deletion_jobs`, never touching `ingestion_jobs`.

### Lifecycle precedence — deletion always wins

`derive_lifecycle_status()` (`app/services/document_query_service.py`) now takes the document's
latest `DocumentDeletionJob` (if any) as an additional input and checks it **first**, before the
existing ingestion-derived rule:

| Latest deletion job | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `PENDING`/`PROCESSING` | `deleting` |
| `PARTIALLY_FAILED` | `deletion_failed` |
| `COMPLETED` | `deleted` |
| none | falls through to the ingestion-derived rule (see "Document read APIs" above) |

Once a document is `deleted`, nothing about its (unchanged) `Document.collection_name`/
`indexed_at`/`IngestionJob` columns can ever make it look `indexed`/`pending`/etc. again — the
deletion job, not those columns, is authoritative for lifecycle purposes from that point on. A
deleted document remains listed/inspectable via `GET /api/v1/documents` and `GET
/api/v1/documents/{id}` (lifecycle=`deleted`) — read APIs never filter it out.

### Public API

- **`DELETE /api/v1/documents/{document_id}`** — `202` when a new deletion was scheduled
  (`created=true`) or an existing active job was returned (`created=false`); `200` when the
  document was already fully deleted (idempotent, `created=false`); `404` if the document does
  not exist; `409` if the document has an active (`PENDING`/`PROCESSING`) ingestion job. Body:
  `{document_id, deletion_job_id, status, created}`.
- **`GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/deletion`** — the document's latest deletion attempt:
  `{document_id, deletion_job_id, status, vector_cleanup_completed, storage_cleanup_completed,
  safe_message, created_at, updated_at, completed_at}`. `404` if no deletion was ever requested
  for this document. Never exposes a storage key/bucket, Qdrant collection name, or raw provider
  exception — `safe_message` is always `sanitize_deletion_error()`'s fixed, generic text (`None`
  when there is no recorded failure).
- **`GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/download`** on a `deleted` document returns **`410
  Gone`**, not `404` — the Postgres resource still exists; only its content was intentionally
  removed. This is checked before any storage I/O is attempted.
- **`POST /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/ingestion/retry`** rejects with **`409`** whenever *any*
  `DocumentDeletionJob` exists for the document at all (`deleting`/`deletion_failed`/`deleted`) —
  checked first, before any of `retry_ingestion()`'s existing ingestion-status branches — so a
  document is never implicitly resurrected by retrying its ingestion once deletion has begun.

### Error model

Stable, machine-identifiable public error codes (`DeletionErrorCode`, StrEnum):
`DOCUMENT_VECTOR_CLEANUP_FAILED`, `DOCUMENT_STORAGE_CLEANUP_FAILED`. `sanitize_deletion_error()`
maps a stored `error_code` to one of two fixed, generic public messages (or a generic fallback for
an unrecognized code) — the raw `error_message` (which may embed a Qdrant/MinIO connection detail)
never reaches a client; it stays in Postgres for operator/log inspection only, mirroring
`sanitize_ingestion_error()`'s existing pattern exactly.

### Explicit exclusions (Phase 2.8.4)

Physical deletion of the `Document` row; cascading deletion of `IngestionJob`/`VectorCleanupJob`/
`DocumentDeletionJob` history; hash deduplication; orphan reconciliation; version-aware
re-indexing; re-upload/restore; a deployed background-scheduler process; retention/purge policy;
tenant/user authorization changes; bulk deletion; a vector-only deletion HTTP endpoint; and a
stale-`PROCESSING`-deletion-job recovery mechanism (unlike ingestion, deletion execution has no
analogous `recover_stale_*` operation in this phase — a `PROCESSING` deletion row that never
resolves stays `PROCESSING` until a future phase adds one, exactly as `IngestionJob` did before
Phase 2.8.3 introduced stale recovery for ingestion specifically).

## Ingestion worker

`IngestionWorker` (`app/services/ingestion_worker.py`) is an internal service — **no public API**
— that claims and resolves one pending `IngestionJob` at a time via `process_next_job(session)`:

1. **Claim**: `SELECT ... WHERE status='pending' ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE SKIP
   LOCKED` — Postgres row-level locking so multiple worker instances never claim the same job.
   Returns `None` if there is no pending job.
2. Flips the claimed job to `PROCESSING` and **commits immediately** — a separate transaction
   boundary from the outcome below, so the claim is durable before any processing is attempted.
3. Looks up the associated `Document` and calls the injected processing step (default:
   `_default_process_document`, which runs Document → extraction (`DocumentTextExtractor` —
   see "Document text extraction" below) → chunking (`DocumentChunker` — see "Document
   chunking" below) → embedding → Qdrant upsert (see "Chunk embedding and Qdrant indexing"
   below)) with `(document, job)`.
4. On success: `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETED`, committed.
   On any exception (extraction, chunking, embedding, or Qdrant upsert): `PROCESSING` → `FAILED`,
   `error_message` set to `str(exception)`, committed.

The processing step is injected via the constructor (`IngestionWorker(process_document=...)`) so
tests can substitute a fake pipeline without changing the claim/lock/transition logic. A
`FileStorage` is also injected (`IngestionWorker(file_storage=...)`, defaulting to
`create_file_storage()` if omitted) and threaded into the default processing step's
`DocumentTextExtractor` — the worker never resolves a filesystem path itself.
`IngestionWorker` never imports or calls `LLMProvider` itself — ingestion embeds and indexes
chunks, it never generates text.

**Idempotent by construction**: once a job leaves `PENDING` (to `PROCESSING`, then `COMPLETED`
or `FAILED`), the claim query's `WHERE status='pending'` filter can never select it again —
calling `process_next_job()` repeatedly does not require any separate "already processed" check.

`with_for_update(skip_locked=True)` is Postgres-specific row-locking syntax; SQLite does not
represent it correctly even if it accepts the same SQLAlchemy call, so this project deliberately
does not add SQLite/`aiosqlite` for testing this worker. Its tests use a fake `AsyncSession`
double that faithfully simulates the pending-job filter and `Document` lookup instead.

## Document text extraction

`DocumentTextExtractor` (`app/services/document_text_extractor.py`) is the ingestion worker's
default processing step: given an injected `FileStorage`, it reads a `Document`'s content via
`storage.read(resolve_document_storage_key(document))` and extracts its raw text entirely in
memory — **no chunking, embedding, or Qdrant upsert, and no temporary file materialization**.
pypdf/python-docx/openpyxl all accept an in-memory `io.BytesIO` stream directly, so bytes read
from `FileStorage` are parsed without ever touching a local path — this is true regardless of
which `FileStorage` implementation is configured (local or MinIO). It routes by file extension
(from `original_filename`), then validates the file's basic structure/content against what that
extension claims before attempting to parse it (see "Routing and validation" below). It supports
exactly five file types:

- `.txt` / `.md` — read as UTF-8 text and returned as a single `ExtractedPage` with
  `page_number=None`, `sheet_name=None`. Hebrew and other non-ASCII Unicode content is preserved
  exactly.
- `.pdf` — extracted page by page via `pypdf` (`PdfReader`), producing one `ExtractedPage` per
  page with a 1-indexed `page_number`, so downstream chunking/citation can reference the
  original page a piece of text came from.
- `.docx` — extracted via `python-docx`: all paragraph text joined into a single `ExtractedPage`
  (`page_number=None`, `sheet_name=None`) — plain text only, no tables, headers/footers, or
  pagination.
- `.xlsx` — extracted sheet by sheet via `openpyxl` (`load_workbook(..., read_only=True,
  data_only=True)`), producing one `ExtractedPage` per worksheet with `sheet_name` set to the
  worksheet's title and `page_number=None`; each row's non-empty cell values are tab-joined.

Any other extension raises `DocumentTextExtractionError("Unsupported file type: ...")` — there
is no fallback or content-based detection.

Data types:

- `ExtractedPage` — `text: str`, `page_number: int | None` (PDF only), `sheet_name: str | None`
  (XLSX only) — both `None` for `.txt`/`.md`/`.docx`, which have no natural pagination.
- `ExtractedDocument` — `document_id: str`, `pages: list[ExtractedPage]`, plus a `full_text`
  property that joins all pages' text.

`extract(document)` runs the actual file I/O and PDF parsing off the event loop via
`asyncio.to_thread` (both are blocking operations). `DocumentTextExtractionError` is raised for:
a missing `stored_path` file, an unsupported extension, or a file whose extracted text is empty
or whitespace-only. Any of these propagate up through `IngestionWorker.process_next_job()` and
resolve the job to `failed` with the error message stored — extraction never crashes the worker
process itself.

### Routing and validation

`DocumentTextExtractor` decides how to parse a file from `Path(stored_path).suffix`, then
validates the file's basic structure/content against what that extension claims **before**
handing it to the corresponding parser (`_validate_file_type`, called from `_extract_sync`
ahead of any extraction call):

| Extension | Handler | Validation before parsing |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------|
| `.txt`    | UTF-8 plain text (`path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")`) | Readable as UTF-8 (a `UnicodeDecodeError` is caught and re-raised as `DocumentTextExtractionError`) |
| `.md`     | UTF-8 markdown/plain text (same as `.txt` — no Markdown parsing) | Same as `.txt` |
| `.pdf`    | `pypdf` (`PdfReader`), page by page | First 4 bytes equal the PDF header `%PDF` |
| `.docx`   | `python-docx` (`docx.Document`), paragraph text | Valid ZIP archive (`zipfile.is_zipfile`) containing `word/document.xml` |
| `.xlsx`   | `openpyxl` (`load_workbook`), sheet by sheet | Valid ZIP archive containing `xl/workbook.xml` |

This is still lightweight, structural validation, not full content sanitization — it catches a
mismatched or corrupt file before wasting effort on the wrong parser (e.g. an `.xlsx` renamed to
`.pdf`, or arbitrary bytes given a document extension), each raising a specific
`DocumentTextExtractionError`. It does not validate the upload's `content_type` header, do deep
MIME/magic-byte sniffing beyond the checks above, or scan file contents for malicious payloads —
those remain future hardening if ever needed.

The extracted result is passed directly into chunking (see "Document chunking" below) — nothing
persists the raw extracted text itself.

## Document chunking

`DocumentChunker` (`app/services/document_chunker.py`) is the ingestion worker's second
processing step: it takes the `ExtractedDocument` that `DocumentTextExtractor` produced and
splits each page's text into fixed-size, overlapping chunks — **no embedding generation, no
Qdrant upsert, no retrieval**.

- Input: `ExtractedDocument` (one `ExtractedDocument` covering all of a document's pages/sheets).
- Output: `list[DocumentChunk]`.
- `DocumentChunk` — `document_id: str`, `chunk_id: str`, `text: str`, `chunk_index: int`,
  `page_number: int | None`, `sheet_name: str | None`. `page_number`/`sheet_name` are copied
  straight from the source `ExtractedPage` a chunk came from — `page_number` set for chunks from
  a PDF page, `sheet_name` set for chunks from an XLSX sheet, both `None` for `.txt`/`.md`/`.docx`
  chunks (which have no natural pagination).

Chunking rules:

- **Fixed target size** (`chunk_size`, in characters) and **configurable overlap**
  (`chunk_overlap`, in characters) — both configured via `CHUNK_SIZE`/`CHUNK_OVERLAP` (see
  "Environment variables" below), and both also settable directly via
  `DocumentChunker(chunk_size=..., chunk_overlap=...)`. The constructor raises `ValueError` if
  `chunk_overlap >= chunk_size` or either value is non-positive/negative.
- **Word-boundary-aware**: chunks are built by accumulating whole words up to `chunk_size`
  characters — a chunk never ends or starts mid-word. Overlap is built from the trailing whole
  words of the previous chunk, up to `chunk_overlap` characters.
- **Empty chunks are ignored**: a page whose text is empty or whitespace-only (after
  `str.split()`) produces zero chunks, not an empty-text chunk.
- **Deterministic**: `chunk()` is a pure function of its input — the same `ExtractedDocument`
  always produces the same chunks, in the same order, with the same `chunk_id`s
  (`f"{document_id}-{chunk_index}"`, where `chunk_index` increments continuously across all
  pages of the document, not reset per page).

The chunker's output feeds directly into embedding (see "Chunk embedding and Qdrant indexing"
below) — there is still no table or field that persists chunk text itself in Postgres; Qdrant is
the system of record for chunk vectors and their metadata.

## Chunk embedding and Qdrant indexing

The ingestion worker's third and fourth processing steps (`app/services/ingestion_worker.py`)
turn each `DocumentChunk` into an indexed vector — **no retrieval, chat, or SSE endpoint reads
these back out yet**:

1. **Embed**: `get_embedding_provider()` (reads `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`) embeds every chunk's text
   in one call — `embedding_provider.embed([chunk.text for chunk in chunks])` — returning one
   vector per chunk, in the same order.
2. **Build `VectorPoint`s**: each chunk + its vector becomes a `VectorPoint` with `id` set to a
   deterministic `uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_URL, chunk.chunk_id)` (so re-processing a document
   overwrites the same Qdrant points instead of duplicating them, and the id is always a
   Qdrant-valid UUID regardless of `chunk_id`'s own format), and payload fields `document_id`,
   `chunk_id`, `text`, `source` (the `Document.original_filename`), `page_number`, and
   `sheet_name` carried straight over from the chunk.
3. **Index**: `get_vector_store()` (reads `VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER`) creates the collection named
   `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME` with dimensionality `VECTOR_SIZE` if it doesn't already exist
   (cheap no-op if it does), then upserts all points in one `upsert_vectors` call.

A document that produces zero chunks (e.g. empty/whitespace-only extracted text) short-circuits
before calling the embedding provider or vector store at all. A failure at either step
(`EmbeddingProvider.embed` or `VectorStore.create_collection_if_not_exists`/`upsert_vectors`
raising) propagates up through `_default_process_document` exactly like an extraction or
chunking failure — `IngestionWorker` catches it and marks the job `FAILED` with
`error_message = str(exception)`. `IngestionWorker` still never imports or calls `LLMProvider` —
this pipeline embeds and indexes, it never generates text.

## Retrieval service

`RetrievalService` (`app/rag/retrieval_service.py`) is the internal read-side counterpart to
chunk embedding/indexing: given a query, it embeds it and searches Qdrant for relevant chunks —
**no public retrieval/chat/SSE endpoint exists yet, and no LLM call is made**.

`retrieve(query: str, limit: int | None = None) -> list[VectorSearchResult]`:

1. **Validate**: an empty/whitespace-only `query` raises `EmptyQueryError` before any provider is
   called.
2. **Embed**: `get_embedding_provider()` (reads `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`) embeds the query text —
   `embedding_provider.embed([query])[0]` — using the same fixed embedding model ingestion used,
   so query and chunk vectors stay comparable.
3. **Search**: `get_vector_store()` (reads `VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER`) runs
   `search_similar(QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME, query_vector, limit)`, where `limit` is the caller's
   explicit `limit` if given, else `RETRIEVAL_TOP_K`. Qdrant returns results already ordered by
   score, and `RetrievalService` preserves that order.
4. **Threshold filter**: if `RETRIEVAL_SCORE_THRESHOLD` is set, results scoring below it are
   dropped; left unset (`None`), no score filtering happens.

Each returned `VectorSearchResult` preserves `document_id`, `chunk_id`, `text`, `source`,
`page_number`, `sheet_name`, and `score`. A failure in either the embedding provider or the
vector store propagates unchanged — `RetrievalService` does not catch or wrap it — and zero
matching results (or all filtered out by the threshold) simply return an empty list rather than
fabricating context. `RetrievalService` never imports or calls `LLMProvider`.

## RAG prompt builder

`RagPromptBuilder` (`app/rag/prompt_builder.py`) is a pure, synchronous, deterministic function
of its inputs: given a question and a list of `VectorSearchResult`s (from `RetrievalService`), it
builds a `BuiltRagPrompt` — **no LLM call, no public chat/SSE endpoint, no retrieval of its own,
no conversation memory**.

`build(question: str, results: list[VectorSearchResult]) -> BuiltRagPrompt`:

1. **Filter**: results with empty/whitespace-only `text` are dropped before anything else — they
   never appear in the context or in `sources`.
2. **No-results path**: if nothing remains after filtering, `context` is set to a fixed sentence
   stating no relevant context was found, `sources` is `[]`, and `user_prompt` is built from that
   same fixed context — deterministic, and no fallback content is fabricated.
3. **Label and format**: otherwise, each remaining result is processed **in the order given**
   (the caller's retrieval rank is preserved, never re-sorted) and assigned a stable label —
   `[S1]`, `[S2]`, ... — used as both the context block's marker and the implicit index into
   `sources`. Each context block is `"{label} {source}[ page {page_number}][ sheet
   {sheet_name}]\n{text}"`, joined with blank lines.
4. **Attribution**: each context block has a matching `PromptSource` (`document_id`, `chunk_id`,
   `source`, `score`, `page_number`, `sheet_name`) appended to `sources` in the same order.

`BuiltRagPrompt` fields:

| Field | Type | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `system_prompt` | `str` | Fixed instruction: answer only from the supplied context, never invent missing information, say explicitly when the answer isn't present |
| `user_prompt` | `str` | The question plus the formatted `context`, with a closing reminder to answer only from context |
| `context` | `str` | The joined, labeled context blocks (or the fixed no-results sentence) |
| `sources` | `list[PromptSource]` | Attribution metadata per context block, in context order |

`RagPromptBuilder` never mutates the `VectorSearchResult`s or the list passed to `build()`, and
never imports or calls `LLMProvider` or `RetrievalService` itself — it only shapes already-ranked
results into prompt text, leaving the actual retrieval call to whoever composes it with
`RetrievalService`.

## RAG orchestrator

`RagOrchestrator` (`app/rag/orchestrator.py`) is the single component that composes
`RuleBasedRagDecider`, `RetrievalService`, `RagPromptBuilder`, and `LLMProvider` (via
`get_llm_provider()`) into one call — **no conversation memory, and no silent fallback between
decisions or providers**. It's exposed publicly via `POST /api/v1/chat` (see "Streaming chat
endpoint" below).

`stream_answer(question: str) -> AsyncIterator[OrchestratorMetadata | OrchestratorToken]`:

1. **Decide**: `RuleBasedRagDecider.decide(question)` runs first, exactly as it does standalone
   (see "RAG decision layer" above) — no LLM call is made to route.
2. **`CLARIFICATION_NEEDED` / `OUT_OF_SCOPE`**: yields one `OrchestratorMetadata`
   (`retrieval_used=False`, `sources=[]`) then a single fixed `OrchestratorToken` — neither
   `RetrievalService` nor any `LLMProvider` method is called on this path.
3. **`NEEDS_RETRIEVAL`**: calls `RetrievalService.retrieve(question)`, passes the results to
   `RagPromptBuilder.build(question, results)`, yields one `OrchestratorMetadata`
   (`retrieval_used=True`, `sources` from the built prompt), then streams
   `LLMProvider.stream_generate(f"{system_prompt}\n\n{user_prompt}")` chunk by chunk as
   `OrchestratorToken`s.
4. **`DIRECT_LLM`**: yields one `OrchestratorMetadata` (`retrieval_used=False`, `sources=[]`),
   then streams `LLMProvider.stream_generate(...)` directly from a fixed system prompt plus the
   question — no retrieval call.

`OrchestratorMetadata` (`decision`, `reason`, `retrieval_used`, `sources: list[PromptSource]`) is
always the first event of a `stream_answer()` run; every subsequent event is an
`OrchestratorToken(text: str)`, in the exact order the LLM (or the fixed message) produced them.
A failure raised by `RetrievalService.retrieve()` or `LLMProvider.stream_generate()` propagates
unchanged out of the async generator — `RagOrchestrator` does not catch it to substitute a
direct-LLM answer for a failed retrieval, and does not catch a provider failure to retry with a
different provider; `get_llm_provider()`'s existing no-silent-fallback guarantee (see "Provider
factory" above) is preserved end-to-end.

This required extending `LLMProvider`'s abstract contract with `stream_generate(prompt) ->
AsyncIterator[str]` alongside the existing `generate(prompt) -> str` (previously only
`OllamaLLMProvider` exposed streaming). `LLMProviderStub` — the shared base for
`OpenAIProvider`/`GeminiProvider`/`AnthropicProvider` — now raises
`ProviderNotImplementedError` from `stream_generate()` too, keeping the "stub never calls out"
guarantee for both methods.

## RAG Engine Compatibility Layer

`RagOrchestrator` remains the platform's single reference RAG implementation, but
`POST /api/v1/chat` no longer depends on it directly — it depends on a small `RagEngine`
abstraction (`app/rag/engine.py`), so a second, LangChain-backed execution engine can be
selected without touching the public API, the SSE contract, or any existing
provider/retrieval/prompt/orchestration code:

```
RagEngine (app/rag/engine.py)
├── CustomRagEngine    (app/rag/engines/custom_engine.py)   — default
└── LangChainRagEngine (app/rag/engines/langchain_engine.py) — optional
```

**Contract**: `stream_answer(question: str) -> AsyncIterator[OrchestratorMetadata |
OrchestratorToken]`, plus an `answer(question) -> str` default that collects the streamed
tokens. Both concrete engines yield the exact same `OrchestratorMetadata`/`OrchestratorToken`
dataclasses `RagOrchestrator` already defines — `RagEngine` is independent of FastAPI and SSE
formatting, so `app/api/v1/routes/chat.py`'s SSE mapping needs no engine-specific branch.

**Engine-selection flow**: `get_rag_engine(settings)`
(`app/rag/engines/engine_factory.py`) reads `RAG_ENGINE` and resolves the concrete engine — the
same "resolve, don't branch" shape as `provider_factory.py`. `RAG_ENGINE=custom` (the default)
resolves to `CustomRagEngine`; `RAG_ENGINE=langchain` resolves to `LangChainRagEngine`; any other
value raises `UnsupportedRagEngineError` immediately. There is no silent fallback to `custom` and
no silent provider switch — mirroring the **no-fallback rule** `provider_factory.py` already
established for `LLM_PROVIDER`/`EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`/`VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER`.

**`CustomRagEngine`** adds no logic: it constructs (or accepts) a `RagOrchestrator` and delegates
`stream_answer()` straight to it. `RuleBasedRagDecider`, `RetrievalService`, `RagPromptBuilder`,
`LLMProvider.stream_generate()`, source metadata, and failure propagation are byte-for-byte the
same as before this layer existed — this is why `RagOrchestrator` remains the reference
implementation: every other engine is judged against its behavior, not the other way around.

**`LangChainRagEngine`** (`app/rag/engines/langchain_engine.py`) reuses
`RuleBasedRagDecider.decide(question)` directly, unmodified, *outside* any LangChain `Runnable` —
this keeps the decision contract (which four `RagDecision` values exist, and their `reason`
strings) identical to `CustomRagEngine`'s without needing LangChain to model routing at all.
`CLARIFICATION_NEEDED`/`OUT_OF_SCOPE`/`NEEDS_RETRIEVAL`-with-no-results stream a fixed,
language-appropriate message resolved via `PromptProvider` (see "Multilingual RAG Foundation"
below) — neither engine owns this text or depends on the other's implementation module, and the
two can never drift apart on it — with no retrieval (for clarification/out-of-scope) and no LLM
call at all for any of the three. For `NEEDS_RETRIEVAL`-with-sources/`DIRECT_LLM`, it builds a
LangChain `ChatPromptValue` (from literal `SystemMessage`/`HumanMessage` content — never an
interpolated `ChatPromptTemplate`, so arbitrary document text containing `{`/`}` characters can
never be misparsed as a template variable) using `PromptProvider`'s resolved, language-aware
system instruction, and pipes it through a LangChain `RunnableLambda(...) | ProviderBackedLLM`
chain, streaming the result chunk by chunk.

**Adapter boundaries and provider-factory reuse** (`app/rag/engines/langchain_adapters.py`) —
the *only* place `LangChainRagEngine` touches a LangChain provider-facing base class:

- `ProviderBackedLLM` (`langchain_core.language_models.llms.LLM`) streams from whatever
  `LLMProvider` `app.rag.providers.provider_factory.get_llm_provider()` resolved.
- `ProviderBackedEmbeddings` (`langchain_core.embeddings.Embeddings`) wraps whatever
  `EmbeddingProvider` `get_embedding_provider()` resolved.
- `ProviderBackedRetriever` (`langchain_core.retrievers.BaseRetriever`) wraps the existing
  `RetrievalService` — the same `QdrantVectorStore`, `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME`,
  `RETRIEVAL_TOP_K`/`RETRIEVAL_SCORE_THRESHOLD` filtering, and embedding provider every other
  caller of `RetrievalService` gets. There is no `langchain-community` Qdrant vector-store
  integration and no second Qdrant SDK path — `QdrantVectorStore`'s own `httpx`-based HTTP calls
  are the only thing that ever talks to Qdrant, in either engine.

None of the three adapters construct an Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, or Qdrant client
directly — each one is handed an already-resolved provider/service instance and only adapts its
interface, never its configuration or selection.

**Shared Qdrant/embedding contract**: `ProviderBackedRetriever` returns LangChain `Document`s
built from `VectorSearchResult` (`document_to_search_result()`/`_search_result_to_document()` in
`langchain_adapters.py` are exact inverses of each other), and `LangChainRagEngine` converts
retrieved `Document`s straight back into `VectorSearchResult`s before handing them to the
existing, unmodified `RagPromptBuilder`. This means: same embedding model, same `VECTOR_SIZE`,
same `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME`, same vectors and payload metadata, same `[S1]`/`[S2]` source
labels and rank order, same governance instructions ("answer only from context", "say so if the
answer isn't present"), and the same Hebrew/Unicode handling as `CustomRagEngine` — nothing about
switching engines re-embeds a document, creates a new collection, or changes a chunk/point ID.

**API/SSE independence**: `app/api/v1/routes/chat.py` depends on `RagEngine` (via
`get_rag_engine()`, a route-local dependency wrapping the factory), not `RagOrchestrator` or
`LangChainRagEngine` — the route has no knowledge of which concrete engine is configured, no
`RAG_ENGINE` branch, and (per "Route Layer Style" in CLAUDE.md) no decision/retrieval/prompt
logic of its own either way.

**No-results behavior is identical across engines**: when `RetrievalService.retrieve()` returns
results but `RagPromptBuilder` finds nothing attributable (`built.sources` empty), both engines
stream a fixed, language-appropriate `no_results` message (see "Multilingual RAG Foundation"
below) with `sources=[]` and **no LLM call at all** — `LangChainRagEngine` never substitutes a
`DIRECT_LLM` answer or fabricates a source in that case, matching `CustomRagEngine` exactly.

**Why LangGraph is intentionally deferred**: LangChain's `Runnable`/prompt/retriever primitives
are sufficient to express this platform's existing four-way decision routing plus a single
retrieval-then-generate step — there is no multi-step agent loop, no tool calling, and no
conversation memory for LangGraph's graph/state machinery to add value to. Introducing LangGraph
now would add a second orchestration paradigm with nothing for it to orchestrate; it belongs in a
future milestone only once a real agentic workflow (multi-step tool use, conditional branching
driven by intermediate LLM output, etc.) actually requires it.

## Multilingual RAG Foundation

Phase 2.5 makes multilingual (Hebrew + English) retrieval and language-aware prompting shared
platform capabilities, reached identically by both `CustomRagEngine` and `LangChainRagEngine` —
neither engine implements its own language detection, prompt catalog, embedding-version
selection, or collection routing.

### Embedding/index versioning (`app/rag/embedding_config.py`)

`EmbeddingIndexConfig` is the versioned identity of "how this platform is currently indexing
documents" — `collection_prefix`, `provider`, `model`, `dimension`, `embedding_version`,
`chunking_version`. `get_active_embedding_config(settings)` is the *only* place that reads
`EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`/`EMBEDDING_MODEL` (or `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`)/`VECTOR_SIZE`/
`EMBEDDING_VERSION`/`CHUNKING_VERSION` for indexing purposes — `IngestionWorker` (write side),
`RetrievalService` (read side), and `app/services/reindex_service.py` all call this function
rather than reading those settings directly, so they can never resolve to different
configurations. Every field is validated non-empty/positive at construction — see "Configuration
Must Be Explicit" below.

`EmbeddingIndexConfig.collection_name` derives a deterministic, sanitized Qdrant collection name
from all five fields (`documents__ollama__bge-m3__ev2__cv1__d1024`-shaped) — changing
*any* field (a different model, dimension, embedding version, or chunking version) always
produces a different collection name, so incompatible vectors can never land in the same
collection. `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME` now serves as the `collection_prefix` input to this
identity, not a literal collection name by itself.

### Why incompatible dimensions cannot share a collection

`app/services/index_registry.py`'s `ensure_active_collection()` is the one gate every
write/search path passes through before touching Qdrant: it calls
`VectorStore.get_collection_vector_size()` (new on the `VectorStore`/`QdrantVectorStore`
contract, alongside `delete_by_document_id()`) and raises `IncompatibleIndexConfigurationError`
if an existing collection's dimension doesn't match the active config's — this should be
unreachable in practice (the collection name itself encodes the dimension) but is checked anyway
as a hard safety net against any Qdrant/Postgres drift. **Never** silently recreates or deletes a
mismatched collection; an operator must resolve the conflict deliberately.

### Document/collection indexing metadata (Postgres)

`IndexCollection` (`app/models/index_collection.py`) tracks one row per distinct collection ever
created: `collection_name` (primary key), `embedding_provider`, `embedding_model`,
`embedding_dimension`, `embedding_version`, `chunking_version`, `status` (`active`/`retired`),
`created_at`. `Document` (`app/models/document.py`) gained matching `embedding_*`/
`chunking_version`/`collection_name`/`indexed_at` columns, populated only by
`app/services/index_registry.py`'s `mark_document_indexed()` **after** a successful
index/re-index — a failed attempt never updates them. `is_document_stale(document, config)`
compares `document.collection_name` against the active config's collection name — a document
with vectors sitting in some collection is not "current" merely because vectors exist somewhere;
it is current only if its stored configuration matches the active one exactly. Migration:
`alembic/versions/07f849bf2b95_...py`. `Document` also carries the provider-neutral storage
identity added by Phase 2.6/2.7 (`storage_provider`/`storage_bucket`/`storage_key`/
`storage_etag`), migration `alembic/versions/a3f9c7d2e1b5_add_document_storage_identity_
columns.py` — see "Storage Abstraction" above and "Backward compatibility for pre-migration
documents" below.

PostgreSQL remains the source-of-truth for document lifecycle/metadata, storage identity, and
active versions; `FileStorage` (local disk or MinIO, per `FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER`) holds the
original file content; Qdrant is a **derived** index, rebuildable at any time from the persisted
file + the active `EmbeddingIndexConfig` via re-index (below) — never itself the source of truth
for what a document "is." MinIO is object storage, not the lifecycle source of truth either —
`Document`'s Postgres row is what determines a document's lifecycle state.

### Backward compatibility for pre-migration documents

A `Document` row written before Phase 2.6/2.7 has `storage_key IS NULL`. Migration
`a3f9c7d2e1b5` backfills `storage_provider='local'` and `storage_key=stored_filename` for every
existing row at upgrade time — the pre-migration `LocalFileStorage` always wrote files flat under
its configured root, keyed by `stored_filename`, so that value is exactly the object key the new
`LocalFileStorage` needs to locate the same file; no file content is read and no data is moved
during the migration. `stored_path`/`stored_filename` are kept (not dropped, not renamed) for
this reason. Any code addressing a document's content calls
`app.storage.keys.resolve_document_storage_key(document)`, which returns `storage_key` if set,
else falls back to `stored_path` — so a pre-migration row remains fully readable without any
special-casing at the call site.

### Re-index (`app/services/reindex_service.py`)

`reindex_document(document, session, settings, file_storage=None) -> ReindexResult` re-derives a
document's vectors from its already-persisted stored content — no new upload required (`
file_storage` defaults to `create_file_storage(settings)` if omitted). Flow: re-extract
(`DocumentTextExtractor`, reading via the injected `FileStorage`) -> re-chunk (`DocumentChunker`,
active `chunking_version`) -> re-embed (active `EmbeddingIndexConfig`) -> validate real vector
dimensions (`app/rag/embedding_validation.py`) -> `ensure_active_collection()` -> upsert into the
new collection -> `mark_document_indexed()` + commit -> attempt to delete the document's vectors
from
its *previous* tracked collection (if any, and if different from the new one).

`ReindexResult` (`outcome: ReindexOutcome`, `document`) replaces the old plain-`bool` return —
`bool` could not represent the distinct outcomes below:

- `ALREADY_CURRENT` — no-op, the document already matches the active configuration.
- `REINDEXED` — successful, non-empty re-index.
- `REINDEXED_EMPTY` — the document produced zero chunks (see "Zero-chunk behavior" below); marked
  current anyway, with no vectors written.
- `REINDEXED_WITH_CLEANUP_PENDING` — the new collection/metadata committed successfully, but
  deleting the previous collection's vectors failed; see "Legacy-vector cleanup" below. The
  re-index itself is **not** reported as a failure.

Idempotent: point IDs are derived identically to the initial-ingest path
(`app.services.ingestion_worker.to_vector_point`, made public specifically so
`reindex_service.py` can reuse it), so re-running against the same active collection overwrites
rather than duplicates.

**Transaction semantics — Qdrant and PostgreSQL are never one atomic transaction.** Three
distinct failure modes, each with different observable state:

1. **Extraction/chunking/embedding/validation/collection/upsert failure** (before the metadata
   commit): the exception propagates, no Document indexing metadata is ever committed, and no
   previously-valid vectors are touched. `is_document_stale()` still reports the document stale.
2. **The Qdrant upsert succeeds but the following Postgres commit fails** (e.g. a dropped
   connection): `reindex_document()` calls `session.rollback()` then `session.expire(document)`
   before re-raising, so no mutated in-memory attribute survives the failed commit and the next
   access re-reads the true (unchanged) persisted state. **This is intentionally not
   indistinguishable from an attempt that never ran** — the new points already exist in Qdrant.
   Deterministic point IDs make this safe: the next successful re-index attempt overwrites the
   same points rather than duplicating them, and no cleanup ever runs against orphaned points
   from a failed attempt (cleanup only triggers after a *successful* metadata commit).
3. **The previous-collection vector delete fails after a successful metadata commit** — tracked
   as a `REINDEXED_WITH_CLEANUP_PENDING` outcome, described next; the document IS current, this is
   not classified as a re-index failure.

### Zero-chunk behavior

A document whose extracted text produces zero chunks (e.g. genuinely empty content) is still
marked indexed — via the same `mark_document_indexed()` call, with zero vectors written — rather
than being silently left permanently stale. Both `IngestionWorker`'s default processing step and
`reindex_document()` (as `ReindexOutcome.REINDEXED_EMPTY`) apply this identically: no false claim
that searchable content exists, and predictable no-results behavior at retrieval time (there is
simply nothing in the collection for that document to match against).

### Legacy-vector cleanup (`VectorCleanupJob`)

`VectorCleanupJob` (`app/models/vector_cleanup_job.py`; migration
`alembic/versions/1c2d9f3a7b4e_...py`) durably tracks a legacy collection's vectors still needing
deletion after a re-index, independently of whether the document itself is still considered
stale — so a cleanup failure is never silently lost or conflated with re-index failure, and stays
discoverable/retryable even once the document is current. One row per `(document_id,
collection_name)`, with `status` (`pending`/`failed`/`completed`), `attempts`, `last_error`,
`created_at`, `completed_at`. Multiple pending rows for the same document (different historical
collections) are supported and never overwrite each other.

`app/services/index_registry.py` provides: `create_cleanup_job()` (called by `reindex_document()`
immediately after a failed delete, recording the first attempt's error), `get_pending_cleanup_jobs()`
(every `pending`/`failed` row, optionally scoped to one document), and `retry_cleanup_job()`
(retries the delete; marks `completed` on success or increments `attempts`/records `last_error`
and stays `failed` otherwise — idempotent, since retrying a delete against already-empty vectors
is a harmless no-op).

**Two separate vector-deletion operations, deliberately not one.**
`delete_current_document_vectors(document, vector_store)` targets only the document's
currently-tracked collection (`document.collection_name`) — it never consults
`VectorCleanupJob` (no `session` parameter at all), so it is explicitly a *partial* operation,
valid only for call sites that provably have no historical cleanup to check (e.g. a document
never re-indexed) or that intentionally want the narrower scope (rollback, current-index
repair). `delete_all_tracked_document_vectors(document, vector_store, session)` is the *full*
operation — `session` is mandatory, since a full deletion requires a PostgreSQL lookup of every
`VectorCleanupJob` still `pending`/`failed` for the document; those rows are the sole source of
truth for which historical collections might still hold vectors. It attempts the document's
active collection plus every distinct historical collection from those jobs (deduplicated,
preserving first-seen order), and — critically — attempts *every* resolved collection
independently: one collection's delete failing never stops, skips, or aborts attempts against
the others, and never falls back to active-only semantics. It returns a typed
`VectorDeletionResult` (`document_id`, `attempted_collections`, and one
`CollectionVectorDeletionResult` per collection with `succeeded`/`error`, plus a
`fully_deleted` convenience property) rather than a bare `None`/`bool`, precisely because a
partial cleanup must never be reported — or silently treated by a caller — as a complete
document deletion. Calling it again after a partial failure safely retries every tracked
collection, not just the ones that failed previously (deletes are idempotent against Qdrant).
Any user-facing or lifecycle-level document deletion must call
`delete_all_tracked_document_vectors()` — no such endpoint exists yet in this phase. This
function does not mutate `VectorCleanupJob` bookkeeping, does not delete the `Document` row,
object-storage file, or ingestion job — those remain separate, deliberate operations for a
future document-deletion endpoint. Completed cleanup jobs are retained (audit trail), never
auto-deleted.

`app/services/index_registry.py` additionally provides `get_stale_documents()` (list every
document whose `collection_name` isn't the active one) and `retire_collection()`
(bookkeeping-only status flip, never deletes Qdrant data). Migrating to a new embedding/chunking
version is therefore: bump `EMBEDDING_VERSION`/`CHUNKING_VERSION` -> the next re-index run creates
the new collection -> `get_stale_documents()` finds what still needs re-indexing -> old
collections are never auto-deleted at startup; `retire_collection()` plus a manual Qdrant
collection delete is the explicit cleanup boundary for once a migration is known-successful. A
full admin migration UI is out of scope.

### Language detection (`app/rag/language.py`)

`LanguageDetector` (ABC) / `ScriptBasedLanguageDetector` (the only implementation) resolves a
question to `SupportedLanguage.HE` or `SupportedLanguage.EN` — deterministic, word-level
Hebrew/Latin script-dominance counting (not character-level, and not an ML model): each
whitespace/punctuation-split word is classified as Hebrew, Latin, or ignored (digits/
punctuation-only), and whichever script has more *words* wins. Word-level (not character-level)
classification is what keeps a handful of Latin-script technical identifiers (Kafka, Qdrant,
Kubernetes, LangChain) embedded in an otherwise-Hebrew sentence from outweighing the surrounding
natural-language Hebrew words, and vice versa. An exact tie, or no Hebrew/Latin words at all
(empty/punctuation/numbers-only), falls back to `DEFAULT_RESPONSE_LANGUAGE`. Neither engine calls
this directly — both reach it only through `PromptProvider`.

### PromptCatalog / PromptProvider / ResolvedPrompt (`app/rag/prompts/`)

`PromptType` (`grounded_answer`, `direct_answer`, `clarification`, `no_results`, `out_of_scope`)
x `SupportedLanguage` (`he`, `en`) -> `PromptCatalog`. The two generation-backed types
(grounded_answer/direct_answer) use **one English-authored governance instruction each — never
duplicated per language** (`get_shared_instructions()`): answer only from context, do not
fabricate, preserve quoted source text and `[S1]`/`[S2]` labels untranslated, never translate
code/API names/class names/filenames/commands/environment variables/error messages, state
explicitly when context is insufficient. An explicit, per-language response-language directive
(`get_response_language_directive()`) is appended — `"Respond directly and naturally in Hebrew
(he)."` / `"...in English (en)."` — never "answer in English and translate," never a claim that
the model "thinks in English." `get_system_text()` composes
`shared_instructions + "\n\n" + language_directive`. The three no-LLM-call types
(clarification/no_results/out_of_scope) remain naturally authored per language via
`get_response_text()`, since they bypass the LLM entirely and there is no
instruction-language-vs-output-language distinction to make for them.
`UnsupportedPromptLanguageError`/`UnsupportedPromptTypeError` fail explicitly for anything the
catalog has no content for. `PromptProvider.resolve(prompt_type, question)` detects the
question's language (via `LanguageDetector`) and returns a `ResolvedPrompt` (`prompt_type`,
`language`, `prompt_version` from `PROMPT_CATALOG_VERSION` — `v2` since this structural change —
and exactly one of `system_text`/`response_text`); for generation-backed types, `system_text`'s
two components are also exposed individually as `shared_instructions`/`language_directive`. This
is the single seam both engines call.

**Supersedes `app.rag.responses`** (removed): the previous English-only fixed-constants module
from the LangChain compatibility layer milestone is gone; `RagOrchestrator` and
`LangChainRagEngine` both import from `app.rag.prompts.provider` directly, never from each
other's implementation module.

**Phase 2.5 boundary**: this catalog is a flat, hardcoded he/en dict — no persistence, no
runtime-editable prompts, no additional languages, no language detection beyond
script-dominance. A future milestone may introduce a database-backed, runtime-editable prompt
system if the platform ever needs more languages or non-developer prompt edits; do not add that
speculative machinery ahead of an actual need.

### Engine integration

Both `RagOrchestrator.stream_answer()` and `LangChainRagEngine.stream_answer()` now: resolve
`CLARIFICATION_NEEDED`/`OUT_OF_SCOPE` via `PromptProvider.resolve(..., question).response_text`
(no retrieval, no LLM call); resolve `NEEDS_RETRIEVAL`'s system instruction via
`PromptProvider.resolve(PromptType.GROUNDED_ANSWER, question).system_text`, combined with
`RagPromptBuilder`'s unchanged context/ranking/labeling; short-circuit to a fixed `no_results`
message (also via `PromptProvider`, no LLM call) when `RagPromptBuilder` found nothing
attributable; and resolve `DIRECT_LLM`'s system instruction via
`PromptProvider.resolve(PromptType.DIRECT_ANSWER, question).system_text`. `LangChainRagEngine`
builds its `ChatPromptValue` from the resolved `system_text` instead of a hardcoded English
string — everything else about its LangChain `Runnable` composition, brace-injection safety, and
provider adapters is unchanged from the LangChain compatibility layer milestone.

### Multilingual citation behavior

Source titles/filenames, quoted source text, and page/sheet metadata all come from
`RagPromptBuilder`/`VectorSearchResult` unchanged by this milestone — a Hebrew answer can cite an
English-titled source and vice versa; nothing here ever translates a citation or a document
title. Hebrew/Unicode text already survives JSON/SSE serialization (see "Streaming chat endpoint"
below) unchanged — this milestone adds no new serialization path.

### Multilingual embedding model selection

`OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`'s Python-level default is **`bge-m3`** (1024-dim, BAAI's embedding model
supporting 100+ languages including Hebrew) — this is the actual default runtime configuration,
not merely a documented override; a fresh installation must run `ollama pull bge-m3` before
ingesting documents. `EMBEDDING_VERSION`'s default moved from `v1` to `v2` in the same change, so
an installation upgrading from Phase 2.5 (which defaulted to `nomic-embed-text`/768-dim/`v1`)
never silently reuses that now-incompatible collection: the active `EmbeddingIndexConfig`'s
`collection_name` changes, existing documents are reported stale by `is_document_stale()`, and
must go through `reindex_document()` (see "Re-index and collection migration" below) to be
searchable again under the new config. **The previous `nomic-embed-text`/`v1` collection and its
vectors are never deleted automatically** — `retire_collection()` remains a bookkeeping-only
status flip.

The legacy English-oriented `nomic-embed-text` (768-dim) model remains configurable — set
`EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text` + `VECTOR_SIZE=768` + `EMBEDDING_VERSION=v1` — but
`.env.example`/README no longer present it as the recommended default; it is documented only as
an explicit opt-out for installations that don't need Hebrew retrieval.

Automated tests (unit/integration/E2E) never depend on a real embedding model or download — they
use `MultilingualFakeEmbeddingProvider` (`tests/multilingual_fixtures.py`), a deterministic
bag-of-concepts hashing embedding with a small Hebrew/English synonym table (e.g. "vacation" and
"חופשה" hash to the same dimension), so equivalent cross-language concepts score genuinely
higher than an unrelated distractor — this demonstrates the retrieval *wiring* works
cross-language, not real multilingual model quality. See "Real multilingual runtime smoke" below
for an optional, manual, non-blocking check against a real `bge-m3` Ollama model; broader
recall/ranking evaluation on a larger corpus remains future work, and this project's automated
suites deliberately never pull or call a real embedding/LLM model (see "AI-provider policy in
tests" below).

## Streaming chat endpoint

`POST /api/v1/chat` (`app/api/v1/routes/chat.py`) is the first public endpoint that produces an
end-to-end RAG answer. It is deliberately a **thin route**: it validates the request, resolves a
`RagEngine` via a FastAPI dependency (`get_rag_engine()` in the route module, wrapping
`app.rag.engines.engine_factory.get_rag_engine()` — see "RAG Engine Compatibility Layer" above),
and formats `stream_answer()`'s output as Server-Sent Events — it contains no decision,
retrieval, or prompt-building logic, makes no direct call to any provider factory
(`get_embedding_provider()`/`get_vector_store()`/`get_llm_provider()`) or to
`RuleBasedRagDecider`/`RetrievalService`/`RagPromptBuilder`, and does not know or branch on
whether `CustomRagEngine` or `LangChainRagEngine` is configured — those all live inside whichever
`RagEngine` is resolved, which the route only consumes.

- **Request**: `ChatRequest` (`app/schemas/chat.py`) — `{"question": str}` only. A
  `field_validator` rejects an empty/whitespace-only `question`, which FastAPI turns into a
  standard `422` response before the route body ever runs. There is no `model` field: neither
  `RagEngine.stream_answer()` nor `LLMProvider` currently accepts a validated per-request
  model override, so none is exposed — adding one is future work, not a silent gap. The embedding
  model is never client-selectable, matching the existing `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`-is-fixed rule
  (see "LLM provider vs. model" above).
- **Response**: `StreamingResponse(..., media_type="text/event-stream")`, wrapping an async
  generator (`_stream_chat_events`) that iterates `RagOrchestrator.stream_answer(question)` and
  yields each event already SSE-formatted (`event: <name>\ndata: <JSON>\n\n`) — tokens are
  written to the response as the orchestrator produces them, never buffered into one full-text
  response first.
- **Event mapping**: `OrchestratorMetadata` → `metadata` (`decision.value`, `reason`,
  `retrieval_used`, `sources` — each `PromptSource` becomes `document_id`, `chunk_id`, `source`,
  `score`, plus `page_number`/`sheet_name` only when not `None`); `OrchestratorToken` → `token`
  (`text`); normal generator completion → `done` (`status: "completed"`), emitted exactly once
  and only after every token; an exception raised while consuming `stream_answer()` → `error`
  (`message` — a single fixed string, `status: "failed"`), and the stream ends there with no
  `done` event.
- **Error safety**: the `error` event's `message` is always the fixed string `"Failed to
  generate a response."` — the route never serializes an exception's `str()`, so no stack trace,
  prompt text, secret, credential, internal URL (e.g. `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `QDRANT_URL`), or raw
  provider response body can leak into a client-visible event.
- **No silent fallback**: because the route does not catch exceptions from individual pipeline
  stages separately — only from the orchestrator's combined stream — a `RetrievalService`
  failure can never be swallowed and silently answered via `DIRECT_LLM`, and a provider failure
  can never be silently retried against a different provider; both simply become the one
  `error` event.
- **Cancellation**: the route catches `Exception`, not `BaseException`, so
  `asyncio.CancelledError` (raised into the generator when a client disconnects mid-stream) is
  never caught as a normal failure — it propagates and lets the ASGI server clean up the
  connection normally, instead of the route trying to write an `error` event to an already-closed
  socket.

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What does the uploaded document say?"}'
```

## Test architecture

Tests are split into tiers by what they need to run, each with a different speed/fidelity
trade-off:

- **Unit tests** (`tests/*.py`, unmarked/default) — fakes and mocks only (fake sessions, fake
  providers, mocked `httpx` transports); no real database, no real Qdrant, no real network, no
  Docker. Fast (the whole suite runs in well under a second) and always run by `make test`/
  `make verify`. **One deliberate exception**: document-deletion unit tests live under
  `tests/unit/services/documents/` (`test_deletion_service.py`/`test_deletion_worker.py`),
  mirroring `app/services/documents/`'s module split — this is currently the only nested unit-test
  directory in the repository; every other unit test file remains flat directly under `tests/`.
  Extending this nested convention to other features is a deliberate future decision, not
  something this split silently generalizes.
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/*.py`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, auto-applied by
  `tests/integration/conftest.py`) — real, ephemeral Postgres and Qdrant containers started via
  [Testcontainers for Python](https://testcontainers-python.readthedocs.io/), never the
  repository's `docker-compose.yml`, on dynamically assigned ports with no persistent volumes.
  Covers behavior a mock/fake cannot faithfully represent: Alembic migrations against a real
  schema, `IngestionWorker`'s `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claim semantics under genuine
  Postgres transaction locking, and Qdrant's actual HTTP request/response contract. AI providers
  stay fake and deterministic even here — no real Ollama container, no model pulled — see
  "AI-provider policy" below. Run via `make test-integration`/`make verify-integration`, never as
  part of `make test`/`make verify`.
- **Backend E2E tests** (`tests/e2e/backend/*.py`, `@pytest.mark.e2e`, auto-applied by
  `tests/e2e/backend/conftest.py`) — exercises the complete backend user flow through real HTTP:
  document upload → real `IngestionWorker` processing (extraction, chunking, Qdrant upsert) →
  retrieval/orchestration → the streaming chat SSE endpoint, consumed incrementally so event
  order/timing is genuinely exercised rather than inspected as one buffered string. Runs the real
  FastAPI app behind a real ASGI HTTP client (`httpx.AsyncClient` + `ASGITransport`), against its
  own ephemeral Testcontainers-managed Postgres and Qdrant — never `docker-compose.yml`, never
  fixed ports, with an isolated database and Qdrant collection per test. AI providers stay fake
  and deterministic here too — no real Ollama container, no model pulled — see "AI-provider
  policy" below. Run via `make test-e2e-backend`/`make verify-e2e-backend`, never as part of
  `make test`/`make verify`, and not added to the pre-commit hook.
- **Frontend E2E tests** — future milestone; no frontend exists yet in this repository.
- **Real-AI smoke tests** — future milestone, kept deliberately separate from the unit,
  integration, and backend E2E suites: a small, manual/nightly suite that runs against a real
  Ollama container with real models pulled, to catch drift in actual model behavior/output shape
  without paying that cost (container pull time, model pull time, non-determinism) on every
  commit.

**Local development** (running the app, trying it end-to-end by hand) continues to use
`docker-compose.yml` exactly as before — nothing about that workflow changes. Tests, in any tier,
must never depend on `docker-compose.yml` being up or on any state it created; the integration and
backend E2E suites' fixtures (`tests/integration/conftest.py`, `tests/e2e/backend/conftest.py`)
start their own containers from scratch every session and guard against ever pointing at a
production `APP_ENV`/`DATABASE_URL`/`QDRANT_URL`.

The RAG engine compatibility layer's tests span all three tiers above rather than forming a
separate tier of their own: `tests/test_rag_engine_factory.py`/`test_custom_rag_engine.py`/
`test_langchain_rag_engine.py`/`test_langchain_adapters.py`/`test_prompt_provider_engine_parity.py`
are unit tests, `tests/integration/test_langchain_rag_engine_integration.py` is an integration
test (real ephemeral Qdrant, existing `VectorPoint` format, fake embeddings), and
`tests/e2e/backend/test_rag_engine_parity.py` runs the full backend E2E flow under both
`RAG_ENGINE=custom` and `RAG_ENGINE=langchain`, comparing source IDs/ranking/metadata/SSE
ordering/error/no-results behavior for equivalence (the generated answer text may legitimately
differ). `make test-rag-engines`/`make verify-rag-engines` run just these files across all three
tiers as a convenience — they are not a substitute for `make verify`/`verify-integration`/
`verify-e2e-backend`, which still cover everything including this layer.

The Phase 2.5 multilingual RAG foundation's tests follow the same span-all-three-tiers pattern:
`tests/test_embedding_config.py`/`test_index_registry.py`/`test_language_detector.py`/
`test_prompt_catalog.py`/`test_reindex_service.py` (plus the shared
`test_prompt_provider_engine_parity.py` above) are unit tests,
`tests/integration/test_multilingual_indexing.py` is an integration test (real ephemeral
Postgres/Qdrant — indexing metadata persistence, dimension-mismatch rejection, staleness
detection, re-index, document-vector cleanup, mixed Hebrew/English round-trip), and
`tests/e2e/backend/test_multilingual_matrix.py` runs the full Hebrew/English/mixed-language
document-and-question matrix under both engines. Both suites use
`MultilingualFakeEmbeddingProvider`/fixtures from `tests/multilingual_fixtures.py` — never a real
embedding model. `make test-multilingual-rag`/`make verify-multilingual-rag` run just these files
as a convenience, same caveat as `verify-rag-engines` above.

MinIO storage coverage spans two tiers, plus one focused backend-E2E addition (there is no
MinIO-specific unit tier — `FileStorage`'s contract/local/factory/upload/ingestion-wiring unit
tests already cover the provider-neutral seams without a real object store). Real-adapter and
real-pipeline coverage: `tests/integration/test_minio_storage.py` exercises `MinioFileStorage`
directly against a real, ephemeral MinIO container (bucket init, save/read/delete/exists/metadata,
presigned URLs, not-found/error translation), and
`tests/integration/test_ingestion_worker_minio.py` runs the real `IngestionWorker` pipeline
(extraction → chunking → fake embeddings → real Qdrant upsert) reading content that only ever
lived in MinIO. Public-contract coverage: `tests/e2e/backend/test_minio_e2e.py` runs the same
upload → ingestion → retrieval → streaming chat flow as `test_upload_to_streaming_chat.py`, but
through the real HTTP boundary with `FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=minio` resolved via the app's actual
`Settings`/`create_file_storage()` dependency chain (never a hand-substituted storage instance),
under both `RAG_ENGINE=custom` and `RAG_ENGINE=langchain`. It additionally verifies the uploaded
object landed in MinIO (queried via `Document.storage_key`, read back through `MinioFileStorage`,
byte-compared) and that no MinIO implementation detail (bucket name, endpoint, credentials) leaks
into the public response. The ephemeral MinIO container itself is started by
`tests/support/minio_containers.py`, a small shared helper both `tests/integration/conftest.py`
and `tests/e2e/backend/conftest.py` call, instead of duplicating the `DockerContainer` setup in
each — the container is only started lazily when a test actually requests it, so the existing
local-storage E2E tests never pay for it. `make test-storage`/`make test-storage-integration`/
`make test-minio` and `make test-e2e-backend-minio`/`make verify-e2e-backend-minio` run these
tiers individually as a convenience, same caveat as `verify-rag-engines` above. None of this
covers browser/frontend E2E, real AWS S3/Cloudflare R2, orphan-object cleanup, document-lifecycle
deletion, or production storage benchmarking — see "What is intentionally not implemented yet".

### AI-provider policy in tests

No tier pulls or calls a real LLM/embedding model. Unit tests use hand-written fake provider
doubles (see e.g. `tests/test_retrieval_service.py`, `tests/test_rag_orchestrator.py`). The
integration suite's one end-to-end pipeline test
(`tests/integration/test_ingestion_worker_postgres.py`) runs the real `IngestionWorker` default
pipeline against real Postgres and real Qdrant, but with `get_embedding_provider` monkeypatched
to a small fixed-vector fake. The backend E2E suite goes one step further and exercises the real
HTTP/chat surface too, with `FakeEmbeddingProvider` (deterministic bag-of-words hashing, so a
query genuinely matches its relevant indexed chunks under Qdrant's real cosine search) and
`FakeStreamingLLMProvider`/`FakeFailingLLMProvider` (`tests/e2e/backend/fakes.py`) swapped in by
monkeypatching the provider-factory function each consuming module already imports — never a
branch on `APP_ENV` in production code. Real Ollama stays entirely outside all three suites,
reserved for the future real-AI smoke suite described above.

## Operational Health Contract

`app/api/routes/health.py` exposes four **unversioned** endpoints — `GET /health`,
`/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/dependencies` — registered on `app` with **no
`/api/v1` prefix**. This is deliberate: business API versioning (`/api/v1`, and any future
`/api/v2`) is about the shape of request/response contracts for clients of the RAG features;
operational health is a different, version-independent contract consumed by infrastructure —
Kubernetes probes, load balancers, ArgoCD, monitoring/alerting — that must never need to change
just because the business API moved to a new version. Moving these endpoints under a versioned
prefix later would break every external prober pointed at them; see the standing rule in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

**Why four separate endpoints, not one**: each answers a different operational question and is
polled at different rates by different consumers.

- **`GET /health`** — "is the process up." A static, zero-dependency summary
  (`status`/`service`/`version`), for a human or a very cheap uptime check.
- **`GET /health/live`** (liveness) — "is the process alive and not deadlocked." Never calls
  Postgres, Redis, Qdrant, or Ollama. This is what a Kubernetes `livenessProbe` should point at:
  if it ever returns non-200 or times out, the pod should be restarted — but a downstream
  dependency being temporarily down is *not* a reason to restart this process, so liveness must
  stay independent of every external service.
- **`GET /health/ready`** (readiness) — "can this instance actually serve traffic right now."
  Calls `app/services/platform_health.get_readiness_result()`, which runs every check and
  returns `200` only if every **required** check passes, else `503`. This is what a Kubernetes
  `readinessProbe` and a load balancer's health check should point at: `503` here means "stop
  routing traffic to this instance," not "restart it" — `live` can (and often will) stay `200`
  while `ready` is `503` (e.g. Qdrant is temporarily unreachable but the process itself is fine).
- **`GET /health/dependencies`** — the same checks as readiness, but always returns `200` with
  the full per-dependency detail in the body (`status` per check, `required` per check, a safe
  `detail` string on failure). Intended for monitoring/alerting dashboards and human debugging,
  not for gating traffic — that's what `/health/ready`'s HTTP status code is for.

**Dependency/readiness semantics** — `app/services/platform_health.py`:

| Check | Method | Required for readiness? |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `SELECT 1` via a short-lived async engine | Yes |
| `redis` | `PING` via `redis.asyncio` | No — no application code path reads/writes Redis yet |
| `qdrant` | `GET /collections` (same reachability check `create_collection_if_not_exists` uses) | Yes |
| `ollama` | Reuses `OllamaClient.check_health()` (reachability) | Yes |
| `ollama_chat_model` | Same call, `chat_model_available` | Yes |
| `ollama_embedding_model` | Same call, `embedding_model_available` | Yes |
| `file_storage` | Local: writes+deletes a small probe object under the configured root. MinIO: `ensure_bucket()` (endpoint reachable, credentials accepted, bucket exists/creatable) | Yes |

Every check runs concurrently (`asyncio.gather`) with its own `CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (3s)
timeout, wrapping `asyncio.timeout(...)` around the actual I/O — no automatic retries beyond
that timeout, and no check ever mutates or restarts the dependency it's probing (a `SELECT 1`, a
`PING`, a `GET`, nothing else). A failed check is never silently dropped: `run_all_checks()`
always returns one `DependencyCheckResult` per check, and both `/health/ready` and
`/health/dependencies` surface every result. `redis` is checked and reported everywhere (so
observability doesn't lose it) but is `required=False`, so a down Redis alone can never flip
readiness to `503` — reflecting that nothing in this codebase actually depends on it yet (see the
environment variable table below); this is a deliberate, documented choice, not an oversight, and
should be revisited the moment any code path starts using `REDIS_URL`.

Every `DependencyCheckResult`'s `detail` is a fixed, generic string per failure mode (e.g.
`"Postgres is unreachable."`) — none of the checks ever return a raw exception message, a
connection string, a credential, or a provider's raw response body to the client.

**Thin-controller route, aggregation in the service layer**: `app/api/routes/health.py`'s
`readiness`/`dependencies` handlers do only three things — resolve `Settings` via `Depends`, call
one function in `app/services/platform_health.py`, and apply the status code / return the body
that function already produced. All required-check filtering, failed-check calculation, overall
status calculation, and safe error-summary construction live in the service module as pure,
synchronous, directly-unit-testable functions:

- `build_readiness_result(checks) -> ReadinessResult` — `ReadinessResult` is a small dataclass
  (`response: ReadinessResponse`, `status_code: int`) so the route never computes `200`/`503`
  itself, it only copies a value the service already decided.
- `build_dependencies_response(checks) -> DependenciesResponse`
- `get_readiness_result(settings)`/`get_dependencies_response(settings)` — thin async wrappers
  that call `run_all_checks(settings)` then delegate to the two functions above; these are what
  the route actually calls.

This mirrors how `POST /api/v1/chat` (see "Streaming chat endpoint" above) stays a thin route
over `RagOrchestrator` — routes handle HTTP concerns (validation, dependency injection, status
codes, response shape) and delegate everything else to a service; see the standing rule in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

**Future DevOps consumers** this contract is designed for (none wired up yet in this repository):
Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes, load balancer health checks, ArgoCD rollout health checks
(a rollout can gate on `/health/ready` before shifting traffic to a new revision),
monitoring/alerting systems polling `/health/dependencies` for per-dependency status, and a
future backend E2E suite's own startup check (poll `/health/ready` before running E2E tests
against a freshly started stack, instead of a fixed sleep).

**Legacy**: `GET /api/v1/health` (`app/api/v1/routes/health.py`, `HealthResponse`) is unchanged
and still works — kept for backward compatibility with any existing client — but is superseded by
`GET /health` for anything operational going forward.

## Future LLM provider stubs

`OpenAIProvider`, `GeminiProvider`, and `AnthropicProvider`
(`app/rag/providers/{openai,gemini,anthropic}_provider.py`) are explicit placeholders for
providers with no real implementation yet. Each implements `LLMProvider` via a shared base,
`LLMProviderStub` (`app/rag/providers/llm_provider_stub.py`), whose `generate()` always raises
`ProviderNotImplementedError` (`app/rag/providers/errors.py`) with a message naming the provider
— they make no HTTP calls and read no external API keys. `get_llm_provider()` raises the same
error immediately when `LLM_PROVIDER` names one of these, before any provider object does
anything, so a misconfigured provider fails loudly at resolution time rather than silently
falling back to Ollama or failing later on first use.

Adding a new stub for another future provider means: create a class inheriting
`LLMProviderStub` with its own `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_MESSAGE`, and add it to `_LLM_STUBS` in
`provider_factory.py`. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the standing rule on how stubs must behave.

## Docker Compose topology

All services join the default Compose network (`documents-rag_default`) and address each other by
service name (Docker's embedded DNS). The app reaches its dependencies at:

- `postgres:5432`
- `redis:6379`
- `qdrant:6333` (HTTP)
- `ollama:11434` (HTTP)
- `minio:9000` (S3 API), `minio:9001` (console) — only reached when `FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=minio`

Only the ports needed for host-side debugging are published (`8000`, `5432`, `6379`, `6333`,
`11434`, `9000`, `9001`). In a production deployment, only `app`'s port would typically be
exposed.

```
host:8000 ──► app ──► postgres:5432
                 ├──► redis:6379
                 ├──► qdrant:6333
                 ├──► ollama:11434
                 └──► minio:9000 (only when FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=minio)
```

`minio` is a local/dev-only service — the app does not require it while
`FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER` stays `local` (the default). Start it explicitly with
`docker compose up -d minio`, or switch `FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=minio` in the `app` service's
environment to use it. Credentials in `docker-compose.yml`/`.env.example` (`minioadmin`/
`minioadmin`) are for local development only — never reuse them anywhere else.

## Environment variables

Set via `docker-compose.yml` for containers, or `.env` (copy from `.env.example`) for local runs
outside Docker. `app/core/config.py` (`Settings`) is the single source of truth for defaults.

## Current boundaries

- `app/api/routes` — **unversioned** operational routes: `GET /health`, `/health/live`,
  `/health/ready`, `/health/dependencies` (see "Operational Health Contract" above). Registered
  on `app` with no prefix — never move these under `app/api/v1`.
- `app/api/v1/routes` — versioned business API routers: `GET /health` (legacy, see "Operational
  Health Contract" above), `GET /providers/ollama/health`, `POST /documents` plus the five
  read-only `GET /documents*` routes (see "Document upload and ingestion job skeleton" and
  "Document read APIs and original download (Phase 2.8.2)" above), `POST
  /documents/{document_id}/ingestion/retry` (see "Ingestion retry and stale-job recovery (Phase
  2.8.3)" above — the one mutating route in `documents.py`), and `POST /chat` (see "Streaming
  chat endpoint" above) — `chat.py` is the only router that depends on `app/rag`.
- `app/core` — configuration and cross-cutting concerns, plus `version.py` (`SERVICE_NAME`/
  `SERVICE_VERSION` — the single source of truth for both the FastAPI app's own metadata and the
  unversioned platform health responses).
- `app/db` — SQLAlchemy async engine/session setup.
- `app/models` — ORM models: `Document`, `IngestionJob`/`IngestionStatus` (see "Document upload
  and ingestion job skeleton" above), `IndexCollection`/`IndexCollectionStatus`
  (`app/models/index_collection.py`, see "Multilingual RAG Foundation" above), and
  `VectorCleanupJob`/`VectorCleanupStatus` (`app/models/vector_cleanup_job.py`, see "Legacy-vector
  cleanup" above). `Document` also carries `embedding_*`/`chunking_version`/`collection_name`/
  `indexed_at` columns.
- `app/schemas` — Pydantic request/response schemas.
- `app/storage` — the provider-neutral storage layer (see "Storage Abstraction" above):
  `FileStorage`/`StoredFile`/`FileMetadata` (`contract.py`), `LocalFileStorage`
  (`local_storage.py`), `MinioFileStorage` (`minio_storage.py`), `create_file_storage()`
  (`factory.py`), object-key generation/validation (`keys.py`), and the `StorageError` hierarchy
  (`errors.py`).
- `app/services` — business logic layer: `OllamaClient` (`app/services/ollama_client.py`), a thin
  async HTTP client scoped strictly to reachability and model-availability checks — it
  intentionally does not call generation or embedding endpoints;
  `document_upload_service.py`'s `upload_document()`, which saves content via the injected
  `FileStorage` and persists `Document`/`IngestionJob` (see "Document upload and ingestion job
  skeleton" above); and `IngestionWorker` (`app/services/ingestion_worker.py`), which claims and
  resolves pending ingestion jobs (see "Ingestion worker" above) — no public API — and whose
  default pipeline now calls the embedding/vector-store providers (see "Chunk embedding and
  Qdrant indexing" above), the only place in this layer that does; `DocumentTextExtractor`
  (`app/services/document_text_extractor.py`), which extracts text from a document's stored
  `.txt`/`.md`/`.pdf`/`.docx`/`.xlsx` content, read via the injected `FileStorage` (see "Document
  text extraction" above); and `DocumentChunker` (`app/services/document_chunker.py`), which
  splits an `ExtractedDocument` into `DocumentChunk`s (see "Document chunking" above);
  `platform_health.py`, the dependency checks backing `GET /health/ready`/`/health/dependencies`
  (see "Operational Health Contract" above) — reuses `OllamaClient` for the Ollama check rather
  than duplicating it; `index_registry.py`, the collection-safety and document-indexing-metadata
  service (see "Multilingual RAG Foundation" above) — `ensure_active_collection()`,
  `mark_document_indexed()`, `is_document_stale()`, `get_stale_documents()`, `retire_collection()`,
  `delete_current_document_vectors()`, `delete_all_tracked_document_vectors()`;
  `reindex_service.py`'s `reindex_document()`, the backend re-index capability; and
  `document_query_service.py`, the read-only query/lifecycle-derivation layer backing the five
  `GET /documents*` routes (see "Document read APIs and original download (Phase 2.8.2)" above)
  — never writes to Postgres, object storage, or Qdrant; and `ingestion_retry_service.py`'s
  `retry_ingestion()`/`recover_stale_ingestion_jobs()` (see "Ingestion retry and stale-job
  recovery (Phase 2.8.3)" above) — the one write path in this file's list that touches
  `IngestionJob`, and strictly Postgres-only (never `FileStorage`, never a vector store).
- `app/rag/retrieval_service.py` — `RetrievalService`, the internal read-side counterpart to
  ingestion's embed/upsert steps (see "Retrieval service" above). It is the second caller of
  `get_embedding_provider()`/`get_vector_store()` alongside `IngestionWorker`, and it never calls
  `LLMProvider`. Resolves the collection to search via
  `app.rag.embedding_config.get_active_embedding_config()`, never `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME`
  directly.
- `app/rag/embedding_config.py` — `EmbeddingIndexConfig`, `get_active_embedding_config()`,
  `InvalidEmbeddingIndexConfigError` (see "Multilingual RAG Foundation" above). The single source
  of the active indexing configuration for both `IngestionWorker` and `RetrievalService`.
- `app/rag/embedding_validation.py` — `validate_embeddings()`,
  `EmbeddingDimensionMismatchError`, `EmbeddingResultCountMismatchError` (see "Multilingual RAG
  Foundation" above). Called by `IngestionWorker`, `reindex_service.py`, and `RetrievalService`
  before any Qdrant write/search or document-indexed marking.
- `app/rag/language.py` — `LanguageDetector`, `ScriptBasedLanguageDetector`, `SupportedLanguage`
  (see "Multilingual RAG Foundation" above).
- `app/rag/prompts/` — `PromptType`, `ResolvedPrompt` (`types.py`), `PromptCatalog`
  (`catalog.py`), `PromptProvider` (`provider.py`) — see "Multilingual RAG Foundation" above.
  Supersedes the removed `app/rag/responses.py`.
- `app/rag/prompt_builder.py` — `RagPromptBuilder`, `BuiltRagPrompt`, `PromptSource` (see "RAG
  prompt builder" above). Pure and synchronous — it calls no provider at all (not even
  `get_embedding_provider()`/`get_vector_store()`), consuming only the `VectorSearchResult`s a
  caller already obtained from `RetrievalService`.
- `app/rag/providers` — abstract interfaces for embedding, LLM, and vector store providers, a
  `provider_factory.py` that resolves the configured implementation for each (see "Provider
  factory" above), and three concrete implementations:
  - `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` (`app/rag/providers/ollama_embedding_provider.py`) — calls
    `POST /api/embeddings` for `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL` only.
  - `OllamaLLMProvider` (`app/rag/providers/ollama_llm_provider.py`) — calls
    `POST /api/generate` with `stream=true` for `Settings.resolved_llm_model`
    (`LLM_MODEL`, falling back to `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL`), implementing both abstract `LLMProvider`
    methods: `stream_generate(prompt) -> AsyncIterator[str]` (yields text chunks as Ollama
    streams them) and `generate(prompt) -> str` (joins the streamed chunks). Internal-only — no
    ingestion, no Qdrant writes, no public chat/SSE endpoint.
  - `QdrantVectorStore` (`app/rag/providers/qdrant_vector_store.py`) — calls Qdrant's HTTP API
    for collection create/upsert/search only (see "Vector store" above). Internal-only — no
    document upload, no chat/SSE endpoint, no full RAG flow; `IngestionWorker` (write side) and
    `RetrievalService` (read side) are its only callers so far.

  `LLMProvider` (`app/rag/providers/llm_provider.py`) declares both `generate(prompt) -> str` and
  `stream_generate(prompt) -> AsyncIterator[str]` as abstract methods — every implementation,
  including the future-provider stubs, must implement both.

  Three future-provider stubs also exist — `OpenAIProvider`, `GeminiProvider`,
  `AnthropicProvider` (`app/rag/providers/{openai,gemini,anthropic}_provider.py`) — which
  implement `LLMProvider` but always raise `ProviderNotImplementedError` from both `generate()`
  and `stream_generate()` (see "Future LLM provider stubs" above).

  `OllamaClient` (health checks) is deliberately kept separate from these provider interfaces so
  health checks don't get entangled with the generation/embedding/storage contracts.
- `app/rag/decision.py` — the RAG decision layer (see "RAG decision layer" above): `RagDecision`,
  `DecisionResult`, `RuleBasedRagDecider`. Separate from `app/rag/providers` since it doesn't call
  any provider itself — it only classifies a question.
- `app/rag/orchestrator.py` — `RagOrchestrator`, `OrchestratorMetadata`, `OrchestratorToken` (see
  "RAG orchestrator" above). The only component that composes the decision layer, retrieval
  service, prompt builder, and LLM provider together — no other module in `app/rag` calls more
  than one of them.
- `app/rag/engine.py` — the `RagEngine` abstraction (see "RAG Engine Compatibility Layer" above).
- `app/rag/engines/` — concrete `RagEngine` implementations: `custom_engine.py`
  (`CustomRagEngine`, the default, wrapping `RagOrchestrator`), `langchain_engine.py`
  (`LangChainRagEngine`, optional), `langchain_adapters.py` (`ProviderBackedLLM`/
  `ProviderBackedEmbeddings`/`ProviderBackedRetriever`), and `engine_factory.py`
  (`get_rag_engine()`, `UnsupportedRagEngineError`).
- `app/workers` — background job placeholders.
- `tests/integration/` — the Testcontainers-based integration suite (see "Test architecture"
  above): `conftest.py` (ephemeral Postgres/Qdrant/MinIO fixtures, the production-environment
  guard, the Alembic-migration helpers), `test_alembic_migrations.py`,
  `test_ingestion_worker_postgres.py`, `test_qdrant_vector_store_integration.py`,
  `test_langchain_rag_engine_integration.py`, `test_minio_storage.py`,
  `test_ingestion_worker_minio.py`. Entirely separate from `tests/*.py` (unit tests); auto-marked
  `@pytest.mark.integration` and excluded from `make test`/`make verify`.
- `tests/support/` — small, non-test helper modules reused by more than one test tier;
  `minio_containers.py` holds the one ephemeral-MinIO-container startup routine
  `tests/integration/conftest.py` and `tests/e2e/backend/conftest.py` both call, instead of each
  duplicating the `DockerContainer` setup.

## What is intentionally not implemented yet

- A standalone public retrieval endpoint — `RetrievalService` is only reachable indirectly, via
  `POST /api/v1/chat`'s `NEEDS_RETRIEVAL` path; there's no endpoint that returns raw
  `VectorSearchResult`s on their own
- Persisting extracted text or chunks in Postgres — `DocumentChunker`'s output is only persisted
  as vectors in Qdrant (via the embedding/upsert step); there's no relational table for chunk text
- Anything that continuously runs `IngestionWorker.process_next_job()` in a loop (no scheduler
  or long-running process invokes it yet — it's called directly, one job at a time)
- A public API endpoint for embeddings, vector store, chunking, prompt-building, or
  decision-layer operations on their own (all internal-only; only reachable indirectly through
  `POST /api/v1/chat`)
- An LLM-based (as opposed to rule-based) question router
- Conversation memory / multi-turn context (in prompt building or the orchestrator)
- A client-selectable model override on `POST /api/v1/chat` — `ChatRequest` has no `model` field
- A document-deletion endpoint, an orphan-object cleanup worker, hash-based content
  deduplication, a bulk re-index endpoint, or a real scheduler deployment for stale-job recovery
  (`scripts/recover_stale_ingestion_jobs.py` is manual-trigger only — see "Ingestion retry and
  stale-job recovery (Phase 2.8.3)" above) — those remain future milestones. Retry
  (`POST /documents/{document_id}/ingestion/retry`, Phase 2.8.3) is now implemented; no route
  calls `FileStorage.delete()` or mutates a `Document` row (only `IngestionJob` rows are ever
  written by retry/recovery)
- AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2 as a `FileStorage` implementation, and presigned multipart uploads —
  `MinioFileStorage` covers MinIO/S3-compatible storage generically, but a dedicated S3/R2
  implementation and multipart upload support are future work, not implemented in this phase
- Frontend E2E tests — no frontend exists yet in this repository
- A real-Ollama smoke suite — deliberately kept separate/manual/nightly, not part of the default
  integration run (see "Test architecture" above)
- LangGraph — the LangChain compatibility layer uses only `langchain-core`'s
  `Runnable`/prompt/retriever primitives; see "Why LangGraph is intentionally deferred" under "RAG
  Engine Compatibility Layer" above
- Agents, tool calling, and any LangChain/LangGraph agent packages — neither `RagEngine`
  implementation exposes tool use; both are a fixed decide-then-generate flow
- A LangChain-specific ingestion path, a second Qdrant SDK/collection, or a client-selectable
  `RAG_ENGINE` override — `RAG_ENGINE` is a server-side deployment setting, never a per-request
  parameter
- Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, ArgoCD Application/Rollout resources, or any
  monitoring/alerting configuration that actually consumes the new `/health/*` endpoints — this
  milestone only establishes the operational health *contract* those future consumers would use
- Auth, rate limiting, an observability/logging pipeline, and Redis actually being used for
  anything (it is only `PING`-checked, not read from or written to, by any code path)

These land in later milestones once the infrastructure is confirmed stable.
