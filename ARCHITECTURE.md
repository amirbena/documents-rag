# Architecture

## System overview

`documents-rag` is a local-first RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform. Everything runs on
the user's machine via Docker Compose, with Ollama providing local LLM and embedding inference —
no external API calls or cloud dependencies.

This milestone is infrastructure plus five vertical slices: a FastAPI app wired to Postgres,
Redis, Qdrant, and Ollama, with a health endpoint, an Ollama health/model-availability check, a
concrete Ollama-backed embedding provider, a concrete streaming Ollama-backed LLM provider, a
concrete Qdrant-backed vector store, and a rule-based RAG decision layer. No ingestion, document
upload, chat endpoint, SSE endpoint, or full RAG flow exists yet — the vector store supports
collection creation, upsert, and search only, and the decision layer only classifies a question;
neither is wired into a pipeline by any caller.

## Services

| Service    | Image                    | Purpose (current)                                             | Purpose (future) |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `app`      | built from `Dockerfile`  | FastAPI process: `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/providers/ollama/health` | RAG API: ingestion, retrieval, chat |
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine`     | Relational store, wired via async SQLAlchemy                     | Document/session/metadata storage |
| `redis`    | `redis:7-alpine`         | Available on the network                                         | Caching, task queues |
| `qdrant`   | `qdrant/qdrant:latest`   | Collection create/upsert/search via `QdrantVectorStore`           | Backing document retrieval in a future RAG flow |
| `ollama`   | `ollama/ollama:latest`   | Health/model checks + embeddings (`nomic-embed-text`) + streaming generation (`llama3.1`) | Backing a future public chat endpoint |

The app queries Ollama's `/api/tags` endpoint (via `app/services/ollama_client.py`) to check
reachability and whether the configured models are pulled, calls `/api/embeddings` (via
`app/rag/providers/ollama_embedding_provider.py`) to embed text with `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`,
and calls `/api/generate` with `stream=true` (via `app/rag/providers/ollama_llm_provider.py`) to
stream completions from the configured chat model (`LLM_MODEL`, falling back to
`OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL` — see "LLM provider vs. model" below). The LLM provider is internal-only —
there is no public chat or SSE endpoint yet. The app also talks to Qdrant's HTTP API under
`QDRANT_URL` (via `app/rag/providers/qdrant_vector_store.py`) to create collections, upsert
vectors, and run similarity search — see "Vector store" below. Callers resolve all of these
providers through `app/rag/providers/provider_factory.py` rather than importing Ollama/Qdrant
classes directly — see "Provider factory" below. Postgres and Redis are still unused beyond
connection configuration.

## Provider factory

`app/rag/providers/provider_factory.py` resolves which concrete provider class to construct,
based on three config variables, so the rest of the codebase depends on the `EmbeddingProvider` /
`LLMProvider` / `VectorStore` interfaces rather than being coupled to Ollama or Qdrant directly:

- `get_embedding_provider()` — `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` (`"ollama"` → `OllamaEmbeddingProvider`)
- `get_llm_provider()` — `LLM_PROVIDER` (`"ollama"` → `OllamaLLMProvider`; `"openai"`, `"gemini"`,
  `"anthropic"` are recognized but raise `ProviderNotImplementedError` — see "Future LLM provider
  stubs" below)
- `get_vector_store()` — `VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER` (`"qdrant"` → `QdrantVectorStore`)

An unrecognized provider name raises `UnsupportedProviderError` (a `ValueError`) with a message
naming the offending value and the supported provider(s). All Ollama-specific logic (HTTP calls,
error handling) stays inside the Ollama provider classes — the factory only selects and
constructs; it never reimplements provider behavior, and business/service code should resolve
providers through it rather than importing `OllamaEmbeddingProvider`/`OllamaLLMProvider` directly.
The factory never falls back to Ollama for a misconfigured or unimplemented provider — every
non-`ollama` value either resolves to its own explicit failure or a real alternative
implementation.

## LLM provider vs. model

`LLM_PROVIDER` (which backend to use, e.g. `ollama`) and `LLM_MODEL` (which model that backend
should use, e.g. `llama3.1`) are deliberately separate settings — changing the model doesn't
require touching provider selection, and vice versa. `Settings.resolved_llm_model`
(`app/core/config.py`) is the single place that decides the effective model: it returns
`LLM_MODEL` if set, otherwise falls back to `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL` for backward compatibility.
`OllamaLLMProvider` calls `resolved_llm_model`, never `ollama_chat_model` directly, when building
its `/api/generate` request.

`OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL` is intentionally **not** part of this model-selection mechanism —
embeddings use a fixed model, independent of `LLM_MODEL`, since swapping the embedding model
would silently invalidate any previously-computed vectors. `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` always reads
`ollama_embedding_model` directly.

## Vector store

`app/rag/providers/vector_store.py` defines the abstract `VectorStore` contract plus its shared
data types:

- `VectorPoint` — one embedding vector to upsert, with `id`, `vector`, and payload metadata
  (`document_id`, `chunk_id`, `text`, `source`, optional `page_number`).
- `VectorSearchResult` — one nearest-neighbor match: `id`, `score`, plus the same payload fields.

`VectorStore` methods: `create_collection_if_not_exists(collection_name, vector_size)`,
`upsert_vectors(collection_name, points)`, `search_similar(collection_name, query_vector, limit)`.

`QdrantVectorStore` (`app/rag/providers/qdrant_vector_store.py`) is the concrete implementation.
It talks to Qdrant's REST API directly under `QDRANT_URL` via async `httpx` — **no official
Qdrant SDK is used**, matching the same pattern as the Ollama providers. It calls:

- `GET /collections/{name}` + `PUT /collections/{name}` — check-then-create a collection
  (skips creation if the collection already exists).
- `PUT /collections/{name}/points?wait=true` — upsert points (id, vector, payload).
- `POST /collections/{name}/points/search` — similarity search, returning parsed
  `VectorSearchResult` objects.

`QdrantVectorStoreError` is raised on an unreachable server, a non-200 response, or a malformed
response (e.g. missing payload fields). This provider is internal-only: no document
ingestion/upload, no chat/SSE endpoint, and no caller wires it into a retrieval pipeline yet.

## RAG decision layer

`app/rag/decision.py` is a small internal decision/orchestration layer that classifies a user
question *before* any retrieval or generation happens — it does not itself perform retrieval,
generation, ingestion, or document upload, and is not wired to any public API endpoint.

- `RagDecision` (a `StrEnum`) — one of `NEEDS_RETRIEVAL`, `DIRECT_LLM`,
  `CLARIFICATION_NEEDED`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE`.
- `DecisionResult` — a dataclass with `decision`, `reason`, and an optional `confidence`.
- `RuleBasedRagDecider.decide(question) -> DecisionResult` — deterministic, keyword/pattern-based
  routing. **No LLM call is made to route** — rules are checked in order:
  1. Empty or very short question → `CLARIFICATION_NEEDED`.
  2. Sensitive/private data extraction requests (SSN, passwords, API keys, credentials, etc.) →
     `OUT_OF_SCOPE` — checked *before* the retrieval keywords, so a request that mentions both
     documents and sensitive data is still rejected.
  3. Question references uploaded/indexed documents (`document`, `uploaded`, `pdf`, `knowledge
     base`, etc.) → `NEEDS_RETRIEVAL`.
  4. Otherwise → `DIRECT_LLM` (general question, no document reference, nothing sensitive).

This is deliberately the simplest possible decider — a future milestone may replace or augment it
with an LLM-based router, but the rule-based version exists first so the decision *contract*
(`RagDecision`/`DecisionResult`) is fixed and testable before anything calls out to a model for
routing.

## Future LLM provider stubs

`OpenAIProvider`, `GeminiProvider`, and `AnthropicProvider`
(`app/rag/providers/{openai,gemini,anthropic}_provider.py`) are explicit placeholders for
providers with no real implementation yet. Each implements `LLMProvider` via a shared base,
`LLMProviderStub` (`app/rag/providers/llm_provider_stub.py`), whose `generate()` always raises
`ProviderNotImplementedError` (`app/rag/providers/errors.py`) with a message naming the provider
— they make no HTTP calls and read no external API keys. `get_llm_provider()` raises the same
error immediately when `LLM_PROVIDER` names one of these, before any provider object does
anything, so a misconfigured provider fails loudly at resolution time rather than silently
falling back to Ollama or failing later on first use.

Adding a new stub for another future provider means: create a class inheriting
`LLMProviderStub` with its own `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_MESSAGE`, and add it to `_LLM_STUBS` in
`provider_factory.py`. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the standing rule on how stubs must behave.

## Docker Compose topology

All services join the default Compose network (`documents-rag_default`) and address each other by
service name (Docker's embedded DNS). The app reaches its dependencies at:

- `postgres:5432`
- `redis:6379`
- `qdrant:6333` (HTTP)
- `ollama:11434` (HTTP)

Only the ports needed for host-side debugging are published (`8000`, `5432`, `6379`, `6333`,
`11434`). In a production deployment, only `app`'s port would typically be exposed.

```
host:8000 ──► app ──► postgres:5432
                 ├──► redis:6379
                 ├──► qdrant:6333
                 └──► ollama:11434
```

## Environment variables

Set via `docker-compose.yml` for containers, or `.env` (copy from `.env.example`) for local runs
outside Docker. `app/core/config.py` (`Settings`) is the single source of truth for defaults.

## Current boundaries

- `app/api` — FastAPI routers: `/health` and `/providers/ollama/health`.
- `app/core` — configuration and cross-cutting concerns.
- `app/db` — SQLAlchemy async engine/session setup.
- `app/models` — ORM models (empty for now).
- `app/schemas` — Pydantic request/response schemas.
- `app/services` — business logic layer. Currently just `OllamaClient`
  (`app/services/ollama_client.py`), a thin async HTTP client scoped strictly to reachability and
  model-availability checks — it intentionally does not call generation or embedding endpoints.
- `app/rag/providers` — abstract interfaces for embedding, LLM, and vector store providers, a
  `provider_factory.py` that resolves the configured implementation for each (see "Provider
  factory" above), and three concrete implementations:
  - `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` (`app/rag/providers/ollama_embedding_provider.py`) — calls
    `POST /api/embeddings` for `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL` only.
  - `OllamaLLMProvider` (`app/rag/providers/ollama_llm_provider.py`) — calls
    `POST /api/generate` with `stream=true` for `Settings.resolved_llm_model`
    (`LLM_MODEL`, falling back to `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL`), exposing
    `stream_generate(prompt) -> AsyncIterator[str]` (yields text chunks as Ollama streams them)
    and `generate(prompt) -> str` (joins the streamed chunks, satisfying the abstract
    `LLMProvider` contract). Internal-only — no ingestion, no Qdrant writes, no public chat/SSE
    endpoint.
  - `QdrantVectorStore` (`app/rag/providers/qdrant_vector_store.py`) — calls Qdrant's HTTP API
    for collection create/upsert/search only (see "Vector store" above). Internal-only — no
    ingestion, no document upload, no chat/SSE endpoint, no full RAG flow.

  Three future-provider stubs also exist — `OpenAIProvider`, `GeminiProvider`,
  `AnthropicProvider` (`app/rag/providers/{openai,gemini,anthropic}_provider.py`) — which
  implement `LLMProvider` but always raise `ProviderNotImplementedError` (see "Future LLM
  provider stubs" above).

  `OllamaClient` (health checks) is deliberately kept separate from these provider interfaces so
  health checks don't get entangled with the generation/embedding/storage contracts.
- `app/rag/decision.py` — the RAG decision layer (see "RAG decision layer" above): `RagDecision`,
  `DecisionResult`, `RuleBasedRagDecider`. Separate from `app/rag/providers` since it doesn't call
  any provider itself — it only classifies a question.
- `app/workers` — background job placeholders.

## What is intentionally not implemented yet

- Document ingestion/upload endpoints
- A public chat/query endpoint (including SSE streaming to clients)
- A public API endpoint for embeddings, vector store, or decision-layer operations (all internal-only)
- An LLM-based (as opposed to rule-based) question router
- Any pipeline wiring the decision layer, embeddings, vector store, retrieval, and generation into
  a full RAG flow
- Database models/migrations beyond the empty Alembic scaffold
- Auth, rate limiting, observability/logging pipeline

These land in later milestones once the infrastructure is confirmed stable.
